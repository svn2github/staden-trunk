Notes to developers
===================

The new directory layout doesn't have one single makefile, but rather
two main subdirectories which are expected to be two source download
packages. For historical reasons they're still (for now) within the
one subversion source tree.

Source
------

See src/README.build for full details. Essentially it's running
configure and typing make. If you downloaded the subversion tree (very
likely if you're reading this) then you may need to run bootstrap
first.


Documentation
-------------

See the doc/README for full details. Note that when installing set the
PREFIX to be the same --prefix you used in the src configure step.



Other bits - TODO
----------

demo - largely redundant for now, but I may tidy this up with some
suitable gap4 / gap5 databases and some suitable sequences for spin.

course - still to tidy up. We already distribute a separate course
package on sourceforge (the tutorial), but it's largely out of date.

lib - old tcl code. Most of this got moved to the main source tree,
but there are still various local copies of third-party
libraries. This should be tidied up too.

userdata - maybe merge with demo. It's mostly just some example data for
spin.
