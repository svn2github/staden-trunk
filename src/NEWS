Staden 2.0.0b5,  March 5th 2010
===============================

Gap5 1.2.7
Gap4 4.11.2

This release requires io_lib 1.12.2 or newer.


Gap5 changes since 1.2.6
------------------------

*	Numerous contig editor bug fixes:
	- Major undo overhaul. It should work far better now.
	- Moving sequences moves tags with them
	- Issues with saving giving "error -1" resolved.
	- We can now adjust the read clip points using < and > keys.
	- Fixed an editing-cache problem where cancelling a join and
          reopening the join editor sometimes had the old edits
          retained in memory (but not saved on disk).
	
*	Joining and complementing contigs is now handled better by
        various plots. For example joining two contigs no longer
        clears the contig selector window and plots, but updates them
        correctly instead.

*	Fixed some compilation issues.
	- libpng problems resolved.
	- helped compilation when linking against io_lib releases that
	  aren't yet in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
	- LARGEFILE_SOURCE64 definitions removed, which caused
	  problems on Ubuntu 9 (and others?).

*	Opening a database we do not have write access to (but read
        access) now works. Read-only mode is more obvious in the title
        bar too.

*	BAF export now includes consensus tags.

*	The consensus can now be saved in fastq format.

*	Tg_index gained the option to store SAM/BAM auxillary records
        with "-x". This is experimental at the moment.

*	Tg_index can now stored unmapped data with the "-u" option,
        although it is still visible within the contig editor. This is
        experimental and a work in progress.

*	Improved SAM output - the data is now written in the same
        order it was read (assuming no edits). There is also an option
        to try and fix the flags and mate-pair data when writing out
        SAM, but be warned this is information substantially slower to
        compute and output.

*	Put back the old staden.profile script, but it's now in
        $STADENROOT/share/staden instead of the main root. Also added
        a stash binary to wrap up tclsh so old stash scripts should
        work again.

*	Various speed ups to the template display.

*	The editor control-a and control-e keys (beginning and end of
        sequence) now take heed of whether cutoff data is shown.

*	Export Contigs now picks sensible filenames when changing
        format.


Other Gap5 Bug fixes
--------------------

*	Very long sequences (>64kb) could sometimes cause the cached
        consensus to omit some regions, giving problems for find
        internal joins and save consensus.

*	Block attempts to join a contig to itself.

*	Removed various minor memory leaks.

*	Inserting bases to sequences could previously rarely cause memory
        corruptions.

*	Complement contig no longer moves the used (unclipped)
        start/end positions of a contig.

*	Exporting complementing contigs in ace/sam/baf fixes.

*	Using tg_index -a to add data to an existing database now
        works when the existing contigs have been complemented.

*	Reenabled the Results Manager window in normal mode, rather
        than hiding it for experts only.

*	Gap5's File->New menu item has been removed, use tg_index to
        create databases.

*	Creating a 1bp long annotation in the editor no longer crashes
        if you haven't dragged a selection to cover 1bp.


Gap4
----

*	Alignments in find internal joins fast-mode should have their
        5' end aligned better. (Also true for gap5)




Staden 2.0.0b4,  January 15th 2010
==================================

(Gap5 1.2.6)

Gap5 Changes since 1.2.4
------------------------

*	Added support for lzma (via XZ Utils' liblzma library)
	compression in addition to the existing zlib code. This is
	about 14% smaller than zlib, although at a cost of 2-3x
	slower. Use "tg_index -c lzma" to enable this.

	Also reordered data somewhat for both lzma and libz
	compression, reducing file size by another ~7% when dealing
	data mixed from multiple read-groups.

*	Added an Export Tags function to write GFF data. (Largely
        untested and experimental.)

*	Improved BAF output so it now contains tags.

*	Tg_index now has the ability to select the types of data to
        store using -d. These can one or more from seq, qual, anno or
        name (or "all" - the default). This allows for more compact
        databases at the cost of missing some data.

*	Substantially rduced the amount of I/O operations needed when
        reading the aux file. 

*	Sam/Bam @RG records and the RG:Z:* auxillary tags are now
        parsed. These are used to place sequences into libraries,
        although we may wish to rename these as read-groups in gap5
        too.

*	Added some simple search tools within the contig editor: by
        sequence, name (if indexed), consensus quality.

*	The template display should now be substantially faster at
        drawing large numbers of sequences.

*	Gap5 has a simple mapped assembly menu, currently using bwa
	(which must be installed). Behind the scenes this uses the
	new tg_index -g option to append to the existing assembly.

*	Tg_index -a -g (gapped) mode; this assumes that the sam/bam file
        being added has been aligned against a ungapped copy of the
        consensus from the gap5 database we are appending
        too. Tg_index will add gaps to either the existing consensus
        or the newly input data as appropriate, to merge the two
        assemblies together.


Gap5 Bug fixes
--------------

*	Various cached consensus fixes.

*	Removed occasional memory corruptions while editing sequences.

*	Fixes to the "align" button in the join editor.

*	Improved saving the consensus, involving contig clip point
        changes and pad stripping.

*	Fixed cases of inserting to contigs formed by joining
        complemented contigs together.

*	Fixed several sam parsing bugs.

*	Break contig should produce fewer (hopefully no) inconsistent
        contigs.

*	Export Sequences in SAM format no longer shifts the
        coordinates by 1.

*	Improved maq long/short format autodetection.


Gap4
----

*	Fixed an issue with turning off undo in the "remove pad
        columns" editor function.

*	Fixed an ancient bug involving the C to Fortran interface.

*	Fixed a problem with incorrectly sized trace windows.



Staden 2.0.0b3 
==============

(internal test only of Gap5 1.2.5)


Staden 2.0.0b2, October 16th 2009
=================================

(Gap5 1.2.4)

Gap5 Changes
------------

*	Tags can be created and/or removed within the contig editor
        now, rather than just imported.

*	Gap4's "Sequence Search" function has been added to Gap5,
        allowing for DNA string matches against either the consensus
        and/or the sequences themselves.

*	Name indexing (tg_index -t) now operates much faster
        (sometimes 100x speed-ups). It also occupies far less space in
        the gap5 database, but note that this comes at a cost of
        incompatibility with older Gap5 formats. (This gap5 should be
        able to load up old Gap5 databases, just not vice-versa.)

*	(Experimental) The consensus algorithm can now cache the
        consensus, when in read-write mode. This dramatically speeds
        up computing the consensus for subsequent functions at a cost
        of a bit more storage space.

*	Improvements to the build system, especially on 64-bit
        machines and RedHat derived systems. The --with-iwidgets=DIR
        parameter now has more leeway too and works when given either
        the parent directory or the iwidgets sub-directory.
	"Make depend" is no longer mandatory either.

*	Tg_index now attempts to automatically work out the file
        format (eg sam, bam, ace, baf, etc). The old "aln" default
        format has been removed.

*	Tg_index now supports reading sam files provided they have @SQ
        header lines. In addition to this ace, baf and sam files may
        now be gzipped.

*	Tg_index now has faster read-pairing, using temporary files in
        /tmp. The -f (fast mode) parameter still exists, but should
        not be so significant an improvement now.

*	Added a "-r nseqs" option to tg_index. This change, which has
        been in the code for some time, but commented out, allows
        tg_index to build gap5 databases in excess of 1 billion
        reads. (The largest here so far was 1.9 billion.)
	Do not use though unless tg_index fails or you are going to be
        indexing a very large genome and need to reserve sequence
        space. See ChangeLog for more discussion on this.

*	Tags now interpret "\n" as newline within BAF files.

Gap5 bug fixes
--------------

*	Selecting a region in the contig editor that spans a tag no
        longer crashes Gap5.

*	Fixed a crash when highlighting reading some names in the
        contig editor (buffer overrun).

*	When exporting to ACE format we now write DS lines again, as
        they're needed by consed. Also fixed generation of BS segments
        when adjoining zero-depth regions.

*	Export to SAM format should generate better behaved
        flags. Additionally all positions should now be >= 1, even if
        not positioned that way in gap5 itself. (A shift occurs to
        ensure this is true.)

*	BAF files with blank annotations no longer crash tg_index.

*	(Plus many minor fixes - see ChangeLog)


Staden 2.0.0b1, August 7th 2009
===============================

(Gap5 1.2.3)

Gap5 Minor changes
------------------

*	Added a -f (fast mode) parameter to tg_index. When linking
        read-pairs this links A' to A but not A back to A'. This
        reverse link is desireable, but currently causes major I/O
        bottlenecks on very large data sets. I'll address this later
        in a better fix, so -f will probably be only a temporary
        option.

*	The code can now build without samtools support, although
        obviously it loses the ability to read .bam files.

*	Compilation from source is vastly easier, as is the rest of
        the staden package.

Bug fixes
---------

*	Break contig and join contig are no longer crashing. They also
        now keep track of the number of sequences in the contigs and
        break-contig moves annotations where appropriate too.

*	Fixed a bug that incorrectly caused tags to be considered as
        sequences in some case, causing crashes.

*	The mouse-over for the  contig editor names display now works
        better, no longer attempting to display tag information.

*	Fixed for copy-on-write of seq/anno blocks, sometimes causing
        crashes when saving the contig editor.

*	Clicking on an annotation in the editor no longer causes
        crashes.

*	Removed buffer overrun in the editor get_number method.


Gap5 1.2.2,  June 22nd 2009
===========================

Minor bug fix release.

Minor changes
-------------


*	Added a Hide Annotation setting in the contig editor. This is
        also bound to control-Q (as per Gap4). This allows us a quick
        way to see the quality values underneath a tag.

*	Annotion contents are now visible in the editor information
        line, but the "Tag editor" itself still hasn't been ported
        over from Gap4.

*	Changed SAM reading of LB tags to use TG tags. In practice
        libraries rarely seem to appear directly in the sequence
        lines, but instead occur in read-groups. In theory we should
        then check the main read-group header for LB links from there,
        but for now treating a library as a group (eg a run or a lane)
        is perhaps more useful than a genuine library grouping.

*	Lots of internal code tweaking to support newer versions of
        Tcl/Tk (tested with 8.6b1). For now we still ship with 8.4,
        but this is the first stage of making the code more portable
        and easier to build from source.

*	Extra slider (there's too many I know - it's overdue a
        redesign) in the template display. This governs the "stacking"
        y-mode, controlling where the data gets binned into groups. Eg
        every 1k so that templates 0-1000 are stacked together,
        1000-2000bp are below, 2000-3000 below those, etc.

Bug fixes
---------

*	Removed a memory corruption when displaying long sequence
        tags (> 1Kb).

*	Removed issues with diagonal lines appearing at the start
        of the library insert-size distribution plot.

*	Removed unneeded dependency on C++ (libstdc++.so.5) and
        FORTRAN (libg2c0.so) libraries.

*	The contig selector window now internally uses more 64-bit
        integers. This fixes issues where the total contig length grew
        beyond 2Gb.

*	Initialised more elements in some of the data structures.
        Previously some parts of range_t struct were
        uninitialised. Hopefully this resolves some of the random ACE
        related errors (unknown).


Gap5 1.2.1,  June 15th 2009
===========================

Mostly just a bug fix release.

Bug fixes / minor changes
-------------------------

*	caf2baf now supports annotations.

*	Fixed a crash when storing sequences with trace names that
        substantially differ to the read names.

*	Compiling with optimisation now works correctly. (Previous
        release was built with debugging and no optimisation, so the
        errors were not apparent.)


Gap5 1.2.0,  June 10th 2009
===========================

*INCOMPATIBILITY* The files written by tg_index and read/written by
gap5 are not in the same format as those produced by v1.1.x.
If you wish to migrate existing gap5 databases then it is recommended
that you use the Export Sequences function in 1.1.3 to output in BAF
format, and reindex them using tg_index v1.2.0 with the -B option.


Key changes
-----------

*	Major reduction in disk space required.
	Gap5 databases are now (de)compressed on the fly and so are a
	fraction of their original size. In most cases they'll be
	~20-30% smaller than an input BAM file too.

	This change has also meant less I/O and in particular fewer
	random file seeks. Hence Gap5 is better behaved on the Lustre
	filesystem, although local storage of NFS are still faster.

*	Minimal support for libraries. This is still work in progress,
        but the LB tag in sam/bam format is now used to separate
        sequences into libraries. (More work on this to follow,
        including better use of this information and adding library
        support to other input file formats.)

*	Can now export in ACE format too.

*	Added a -z option to tg_index to allow user specified block
        sizes. I'd suggest using this (eg "tg_index -z 64k") on sparse
        alignment files.

*	Annotatons (aka "tags" in Gap4) have been added. For now these
        are visible by colouration, but no interaction is possible
        yet. The full tag editor is planned for later 1.2.x releases.


Bug fixes / minor changes
-------------------------

*	Fixed a bug in the Export Sequences function. It occasionally
        missed sequences at the very start of a contig.

*	Fixed ACE file reading of complemented data.

*	The file format changes also included better error
        checking. The encoding of each data type now includes the data
        type itself (to ensure we've found the expected type of data)
        and a format code. The format codes should allow for more
        graceful file format changes in the future.

*	Fixed a bug in the count of how many sequences are in each
        contig.


Gap5 1.1.3.1,  May 15th 2009
============================

A minor change to support exporting the data in a variety of formats,
to facilitate migrating from one Gap5 release to the next. (The next
one will have substantially smaller database sizes and faster I/O.)


Key changes
-----------

*	Added an "Export Sequences" function to the main File
        menu. This can output in fasta, fastq, sam or baf format.


Gap5 1.1.3,  April 24th 2009
============================

This version is backwards compatible with v1.1.2 file formats.

Key changes
-----------

*	The contig editor "pack sequences" mode now behaves much
        better. The editing cursor, mouse overs, editing and selecting
	all now correctly compensate for the layout change.

	Additionally the names panel, which was useless in pack
        sequences mode, now displays a reduced ascii layout of the
        sequences allowing for the mapping quality to be shaded
        there and to easily visualise the sequence orientation.

*	The contig editor cursor (editing cursor, not scrollbar
        position) is now both visible and dragable from within the
        template display.

*	ACE format support in tg_index is back, and it no longer
        chokes on RT, CT and WA lines. Although at present I do not
        add this data to the gap5 database.

*	The contig selector no longer automatically displays at start
        up if there are more than 1000 contigs. Using the -csel
        command line option will forcibly override this check (along
        with the previously implemented -no_csel option to never
        display the contig selector on startup).

*	The join editor settings now apply to both editors rather than
        just one. Undo/Redo apply to the last used editor and on mouse-
        over they highlight which editor they currently apply to.

Bug fixes / minor changes
-------------------------

* 	The compute_ypos() function used for the pack sequences mode
        of the editor now uses the faster algorithm developed for the
        template display. Hence "Stacking" mode is now faster.

*	Undo/Redo now behaves better when multiple editors are in use
        on the same contig. Similarly the edits are redrawn instantly
        in other editor views.

*	(Transparent to users, for now.) The initial implementation of
        annotations is in place. This is listed as a minor change for
        now as currently there are no user-defined ways to add tags to
        the database. Warning: this will lead to a file format change
        soon.


Gap5 1.1.2,  April 3rd 2009
===========================

Features
--------

*	The template display now sports a "Filter" button. This allows
        certain types of data to be filtered in/out by mapping
        quality, template consistency, whether it spans contigs and
        whether single/paired.
	(Future plans here include by ligation and/or instrument type.)

*	The template display Y-mode of "stacking" should now be MUCH
        faster when given deep data sets.

*	Added the ability to select regions of a sequence or a reading
	name from the contig editor so that cut and paste works. (From
	the editor, but not into it yet.)

*	The number of sequences in a contig is now displayed in the
	contig selector and contig list windows.


Bug fixes / minor adjustments
-----------------------------

*	The template display crosshair now correctly displays the Y
	coordinate in the bottom status line.

*	Fixed a bug in the consensus algorithm; the last base was
	incorrect when the contig was 1 base longer than an exact
	multiple of 1024bp.

*	Sped up the Save Consensus command when dealing with many
	contigs.

*	Tweaked the Y-spread function of the template display so that
	multiple sequences with both identical X and Y coordinates now
	get spread apart.

*	The contig editor now instantly displays the impact of making
	insertions or deletions instead of only correctly displaying
	all sequences on the next scroll.

*	Fixed an issue of opening contigs when given a reading name
	instead of a contig name.

*	The contig editor sequence no longer vanishes temporarily when
	scrolling the sequence names.


Gap5 1.1.1,  March 19th 2009
============================
