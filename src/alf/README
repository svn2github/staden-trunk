alfprocess Scripts and Filters
------------------------------
The scripts and filters here were developed at the MRC-LMB for INTERNAL
USE ONLY. As we are aware that people elsewhere will want to develop
similar software we include them in the Staden package as EXAMPLES of
what can be achieved.

THESE SCRIPTS WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR SYSTEM WITHOUT MODIFICATION.

This directory contains:
    2rs.c		- filter to convert abi and alf uncertainty codes to
			  staden uncertainty codes
    alfbackup.sh        - script to be back up a folder and transfer to project
    alfprocess		- script to process a batch of alf data
    alfprocess2		- script to process a batch of alf data
    alfprocessDoc	- documentation on alfprocess
    alfsplit.c		- Takes big combined alf results file, and splits it
			  into separate files for each clone.
    alftransfer		- script to transfer alf files into a results directory
    makefile		- To compile c programs

Happy hacking,
