*	BUG: Adjusting clip points of two adjacent seqs in editor
        triggers assertion.
	tg_cache.c:1484: 'ci->updated == 0 || ci->hi->ref_count > 0'

*	Implement disassemble readings

*	Further improvements to scrolling. We could store the Y
        coordinate used in the range_t or seq_t struct rather than
        rangec_t. This means it's effectively cached between calls of
	contig_seqs_in_range.

*	BUILD: Remove -lcurses and use $(CURSES_LIB). This can be set
	up by autoconf:
	http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_with_curses.html

*	BUILD: using -lieee twice causes link errors on opensuse-11.2?

	TK_LIB    = @TK_LIB_SPEC@ @TK_LIBS@ $(TCL_LIB)

	Remove this, or make all code that uses $(TK_LIB) only more
	explicit by also adding $(TCL_LIB).

*	BUG:

	gap5 g_db

	Break Contig
	    Highlight (selecting) Contig6
	    Base pos: 2000
	    OK

	Seems Break Contig doesn't correctly move the 16 reads to the
	new contig?
	
*	BUG: ContigParams "[db_info get_contig_num $io $CurContig]"

*	BUG: Undo doesn't fix edits to tag type / comment.

*	BUG: Moving seqs doesn't move tags on them.

*	BUG: No libpng-devel causes compilation errors still, rather than
        ignoring it as configure implies. (It's still in global.mk)

*	On REG_JOIN_TO, the [$ed io] needs updating to a valid io for
        the contig we're joining to. Rerun "$ed init"? Not quite as we
        don't want to destroy the edview, just update io. Maybe
        overload [$ed io $new_io]. (CHECK: done?)

*	The contig editor needs to handle REG_COMPLEMENT. Either shut
        down or refresh. The complement function also needs to check
        for write access on the root bin & contig struct.

*	BUG: FIJ, launch main, hit align, kill window ('x'), say no,
	launch main again, hit align, press save => "error -1".

	Cause is that the view is invalid - we're attempting to write
	a view that has already been freed. Presumably free in the
	base_io, but still cached so we didn't request a new view?

	Is the problem that the gdb client is the same for io child and
	io_base, so when we gio_close of io child we can end up
	freeing views that are still in use of io base?

	(DONE: problem was base and child both having a reference to
	the same locked view, so do not unlock from child.)

*	$w(io) is top io, eg .e1(io), but we may have two editors as
        in a join editor:

  w:.e1.ed0.pane.seq.sheet     io:io=0xe5cd40/io=0xe10770    base:io=0x89aa50
  w:.e1.ed1.pane.seq.sheet     io:io=0xe10770/io=0xe10770    base:io=0x89aa50

*	After joining, we need to purge the undo history.

*	FIJ - don't clear plot after a join.

*	BUG - delete last visible base in a seq and undo => base gets added
	back as hidden data.

*	BUG: cannot open a database we do not have write access to
        unless we explicitly say -ro. Without it we get a cryptic
        error that to the untrained user would imply the database does
        not exist.

*	Read clipping - cannot do right now.

*	BUG: Outputting to BAF doesn't save consensus tags

*	BUG: DEMO.0.baf: cannot scroll right on read velvet_read#171 unless
        cutoffs shown. Also, can scroll left into cutoff data even
        when cutoffs are not shown.

*	BUG: FIJ with Contig6 with Contig4 in DEMO.0.baf, bring up
        join editor, hit align, then quit (not join).
	Bring up editor for second time and we see the edits have been
        retained. (DONE)

*	BUG: Moving a sequence in the editor and then highting name
        gives crash a crash (s->rec != r->rec).
	Also it means up/down arrow skips lines or doesn't work correct.

*	Control-a and control-e should go to the start/end of clipped
	region when cutoffs aren't visible. (Both seq + cons)

*	BUG: Cut and paste from contig editor fails on complemented
        contigs.

*	BUG: Tag undo (and tag creation) fails on complemented
        contigs.

*	BUG: moving sequences fails on complemented contigs.

*	BUG: move 1st sequence left such that it's in a negative
        position and we lose all display. Why?

*	BUG: Export consensus sometimes leaves pads in even when we
        asked to remove them. (DONE)

*	BUG: can join contig1 to contig1 and hit save. We then get no
        contig1 at all. (DONE)

*	DONE? Fix sam output when a sequence is *AGCTA or AGCTAG*. We
	get things like 1D10M or 10M1D which breaks samtools and
	consequentially tg_index too.

*	Consensus caching (DONE)

*	Finish tag editing (DONE?)

*	DONE: Sequence blocks.
	The caching layer has 1 record per sequence. But rec>>10 gives
	1024 sequences with the same record; pack 1024 in the same
	block using tg_iface_g.c and use the bottom 10 bits as an
	indicator to which sequence we wish to unpack.

	This means some level of caching involved too so we don't keep
	compressing and uncompressing the same sequence blocks
	repeatedly. Which implies tg_cache.c is probably the correct
	layer, perhaps using a new data type GT_SeqBlock?

*	DONE: Add type/format to iface_g I/O
	Every object should start with 3 bits type, 5 bits format.
	- This means we can change the layout of a packed struct and
	  support both old and new layout formats.
	- It also means we can type check and spot stray reads of the
	  wrong object type.

*	DONE: Better formatting of bin range arrays.
	- Try storing start + length instead of start + end.
	- Replace start with delta from previous start.
	- Encode final number series in int7 format instead to reduce
	  size.

*	DONE: Add a means to detect the number of sequences in a contig.
	- Note contig breaking means maybe we need to know this at a
	  bin level; how many sequences are in this bin and below.
	- How to keep this information up to date without undue costs.
	Idea: update the bin we add to + the root bin (or contig
	struct). Add checks in most bin-walking algorithms that
	automatically correct for incorrect bin->nseqs figures. (ie
	parent = child[0] + child[1] counts.)
	

*	DONE: Contig joining

*	DONE: Contig breaking

*	Improved input/output formats
	(DONE: except for $variable expansion)

*	Searching
	- by sequence? (DONE)
	- by position (DONE - padded only)
	- by name (done, but needs a rewrite to speed it up)

*	DONE: Improve template display speed. Maybe C code for rendering to
        a pixmap instead.

	- Store other_end / template info in the range_t array instead
          of the seq struct. This avoids performing seq_t when drawing
          data pictorially. (DONE)

*	DONE: Implement Magnus' Y coordinate algorithm for templates - based
        on size.  (DONE)

*	DONE: Libraries / ligations
