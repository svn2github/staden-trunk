Gap5 1.1.3,  April 24th 2009
============================

This version is backwards compatible with v1.1.2 file formats.

Key changes
-----------

*	The contig editor "pack sequences" mode now behaves much
        better. The editing cursor, mouse overs, editing and selecting
	all now correctly compensate for the layout change.

	Additionally the names panel, which was useless in pack
        sequences mode, now displays a reduced ascii layout of the
        sequences allowing for the mapping quality to be shaded
        there and to easily visualise the sequence orientation.

*	The contig editor cursor (editing cursor, not scrollbar
        position) is now both visible and dragable from within the
        template display.

*	ACE format support in tg_index is back, and it no longer
        chokes on RT, CT and WA lines. Although at present I do not
        add this data to the gap5 database.

*	The contig selector no longer automatically displays at start
        up if there are more than 1000 contigs. Using the -csel
        command line option will forcibly override this check (along
        with the previously implemented -no_csel option to never
        display the contig selector on startup).

*	The join editor settings now apply to both editors rather than
        just one. Undo/Redo apply to the last used editor and on mouse-
        over they highlight which editor they currently apply to.

Bug fixes / minor changes
-------------------------

* 	The compute_ypos() function used for the pack sequences mode
        of the editor now uses the faster algorithm developed for the
        template display. Hence "Stacking" mode is now faster.

*	Undo/Redo now behaves better when multiple editors are in use
        on the same contig. Similarly the edits are redrawn instantly
        in other editor views.

*	(Transparent to users, for now.) The initial implementation of
        annotations is in place. This is listed as a minor change for
        now as currently there are no user-defined ways to add tags to
        the database. Warning: this will lead to a file format change
        soon.


Gap5 1.1.2,  April 3rd 2009
===========================

Features
--------

*	The template display now sports a "Filter" button. This allows
        certain types of data to be filtered in/out by mapping
        quality, template consistency, whether it spans contigs and
        whether single/paired.
	(Future plans here include by ligation and/or instrument type.)

*	The template display Y-mode of "stacking" should now be MUCH
        faster when given deep data sets.

*	Added the ability to select regions of a sequence or a reading
	name from the contig editor so that cut and paste works. (From
	the editor, but not into it yet.)

*	The number of sequences in a contig is now displayed in the
	contig selector and contig list windows.


Bug fixes / minor adjustments
-----------------------------

*	The template display crosshair now correctly displays the Y
	coordinate in the bottom status line.

*	Fixed a bug in the consensus algorithm; the last base was
	incorrect when the contig was 1 base longer than an exact
	multiple of 1024bp.

*	Sped up the Save Consensus command when dealing with many
	contigs.

*	Tweaked the Y-spread function of the template display so that
	multiple sequences with both identical X and Y coordinates now
	get spread apart.

*	The contig editor now instantly displays the impact of making
	insertions or deletions instead of only correctly displaying
	all sequences on the next scroll.

*	Fixed an issue of opening contigs when given a reading name
	instead of a contig name.

*	The contig editor sequence no longer vanishes temporarily when
	scrolling the sequence names.
