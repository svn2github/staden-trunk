0. Introduction

The Staden package (version 1994.2 or greater) now includes the
sequence assembly program Gap. Gap cannot be used with databases
created by the sequence assembly programs Dap and Bap. Similarly, Bap cannot use Dap database files.

People wanting to switch to using the new software will need to
convert their old databases. The program `convert' is provided for
this purpose.

1. The conversion program

`convert' (version 1.1) is an interactive program for converting
sequence assembly data between various formats. With it, it is
possible to convert data in any of the formats:

	text file (created by convert)
	xdap database
	xbap database

to any of the following formats:

	text file (created by convert)
	xbap database
	xgap database


2. Converting databases

The program takes no command line arguments. First, you are prompted
for the format, name and version of the database you wish to convert.
If the source is an xdap or xbap database, ensure that the name and
version are in uppercase. If the source is a text file, the version is
prompted for but it is ignored. Second, you are prompted for the
format, name and version of the database you wish to create. Ensure
that names and versions are in the appropriate case and that the files
do already exist.

After this, the programs converts the database. This may take some
time. The next message to appear on the terminal is a message to
indicate the conversion has successfully completed.

3. Example

Here is a log of a typical conversion session:

    Available types are:
    0. Flat file - created with this program
    1. xdap database
    2. xbap database

    Database type? 2
    Database name? ZK643
    Database version? 0

    Please enter database to create:

    Available types are:
    0. Flat file - created with this program
