abiprocess Scripts and Filters
------------------------------
The scripts and filters here were developed at the MRC-LMB for INTERNAL
USE ONLY. As we are aware that people elsewhere will want to develop
similar software we include them in the package as EXAMPLES of
what can be achieved.

THESE SCRIPTS WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR SYSTEM WITHOUT MODIFICATION.
