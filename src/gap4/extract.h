 * Offset is a value to add to all annotations. Used by the consensus output
 * to shift gel annotations onto the consensus coordinates.
 *
 * If orig is set, then we output the tags relative to their original positions
 * in the sequences. Otherwise we swap around so that they are in their
 * positions as seen in the contig editor. g_sense and g_len need only be sent
 * over when orig is 0.
 * 
 * clip_left and clip_right, when non zero values, are used to clip annotations
 * outside of a given range. This currently only works (as it's only needed)
 * when not shuffling the tags to their original senses.
 *
 * If comment != NULL, a CC line is outputed before the first annotation.
 *
 * We don't output SVEC and CVEC tags as these are included in the SL, SR
 * and CS lines.
 *
 * Returns 0 for success, -1 for failure.
