spin2 / spin2_emboss

Spin2 and spin2_emboss should supersede spin and spin_emboss

New features
------------
* All graphics now use the tk canvas (previously most used tkRaster with
the exception being the restriction enzyme map). This allows the use of
features of the canvas such as tagging to allow more interactive behavior.
It also means that all graphics use the same code and have the same 
functionality. 

* The organisation of the graphics code has been changed dramatically. 

* The graphics result can be rotated 90 degrees to be plotted on the y axis of 
dot plots. 

* The graphics results can be moved to the left or right of existing plots 
aswell as above, below and superimposed.

* Started a graphical feature table viewer. 

* Can do top and/or bottom strand for all graphical results. Top strand 
results appear above the ruler, bottom strand results appear below the ruler.

* Removed keybox from the right hand side and use bindings to highlight and
move plots around. Have 2 bars to replace "all" for moving all plots in a
window and allows collapsing and expanding of a window.

Known bugs
----------
* Having sequences of different lengths on the y axis of dot plots causes major
problems and scaling is not always correct on the x axis.

* The sequence display is partly integrated into the new scheme but since it
was due to be replaced by seqed, this was done only to prove it could work.
It is very buggy.

* reinstate listing output for highlighted match for splice search/wt matrix 
search

* list results for global and local alignments not done. For sip_align this
has been commented out since 27.09.00 ~pubseq/share/src/unused/sip4/backups/
Don't know why this is so.

* need to do string representation of graph object

* plotting sequence display first then doing a base composition plot causes
a crash

* numerous memory leaks

* If the sequence range is the same as the graphics window size (default 
500 pixels), no results are plotted. Scaling bug. Was fixed in spin and gap4
so need to reinstate the change that was made.

* Vertical axis numbering isn't optimally positioned.

* The cursor for the y axis is out by one. 

* Cursor bug:
Find matching words.
Zoom
Double click to get seqs, close sequence display
Zoom out
Now auto-highlight wrongly highlights the vertical cursor (and horizontal one
is nowhere to be seen).

* Cursor bug:
Plot codon pref
Zoom up
Scroll in X
Zoom out
The Y cursor has now moved; it should not have.
The Y cursor is now in three different places; the top plot has one position,
the bottom two have another, and the ruler a third position.

* Plot 2 2d plots. Move the top one to beneath the other one. The new plot
loses both horizontal and vertical cursors.

* Plot a range, then plot over all the sequence. The plot is zoomed but I 
can't zoom back.

* Various binding bugs
