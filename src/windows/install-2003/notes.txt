NOTES
~~~~~

1. We setup a windows NT event log service, in ControlSet001
   which is the default set of configuration parameters.
   Windows 9x will ignore these settings, since it has no
   event logger.

2. The user will need to be in administrator mode to install
   the Staden package. ie. Only system-wide installation is
   supported. This is because an event log service must be
   installed.

3. To drastically simplify the installation, we now use the
   "sprun" program which sets up a staden environment on the 
   fly. This includes the necessary paths and environment
   variables.

4. When setting up shell commands and icons, always use the full
   paths and filenames. Otherwise things go horribly wrong.
   Also all %1 place holders must be in quotes for the command
   line parsing to work correctly in sprun.exe.

5. The App Path must be setup in the registry. This prepends the
   bin directorys to the path before invoking the program.


6. If you want to quicly change the installation directory to
   update the year, I usually do a search and replace in the
   setup.wse script directory. It's a lot faster than going via 
   the GUI route.
