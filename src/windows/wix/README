0. Edit staden.wxs to produce a new Product Id and to update the
   version number accordingly.

1. Produce the distribution directory

   This is more than just a "make install", although thay is obviously
   required too. You'll also need to add tcl, tk, zlib, gcc & stdc++
   libs and any other dependencies into there. Currently this is a
   manual process, so it's perhaps easiest to start from a previous
   install tree.

2. perl /c/jkb/staden/src/windows/wix/generate_wxs.pl c:/jkb/staden/distrib/windows-rel-1-5-3 > staden_files.wxi

   Make sure you use a non-msys perl that doesn't munge pathnames (eg
   strawberry perl), or else compile up your own wix. Otherwise our
   .wxi file ends up containing /c/jkb instead and then light fails to
   find the files.

3. DISTROOT=/c/jkb/staden/distrib/windows-rel-1-5-3 candle staden.wxs

4. light -ext WixUIExtension staden.wixobj
