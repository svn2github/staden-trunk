NOTES:
======

* A -c option has been added to invoke the command console
  instead of winstash.exe. This is tricker than it sounds
  due to the differences between all the windows versions.

  The command console sets up the environment to allow the
  user to use the utility programs found in the windows-bin
  subdirectory.
