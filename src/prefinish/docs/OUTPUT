In detail:

=== EXPERIMENT 4/3: pos -170-230

This is experiment 4 in group 3. Experiments sharing the same primer get
grouped together, so you'll find batches of EXPERIMENT lines using the same
group number but different experiment numbers. The numbers are high as it's
indicating how many have been investigated. Eg:

=== EXPERIMENT 219/200: pos 73447-73847
=== EXPERIMENT 221/200: pos 73447-73847
=== EXPERIMENT 220/200: pos 73447-73847

The position is the expected position of good quality clipped sequence in the
new contig. Negative values simply indicate that the contig will be extended
to the left.

=== Score: 26.017600

Overall experiment score. The higher the better. Units are meaningless as it's 
derived from all the various weights and scores applied elsewhere.

=== Chemistry 17

The chemistry code as used by gap4:

0	unknown		primer
1	unknown		terminator
2	ABI rhodamine	primer
3	ABI rhodamine 	terminator
4	ABI dRhodamine 	primer
5	ABI dRhodamine 	terminator
6	ABI BigDye v2 	primer
7	ABI BigDye v2 	terminator
8	Energy transfer	primer
9	Energy transfer	terminator
10	Licor 		primer
11	Licor 		terminator
12	MegaBACE ET 	primer
13	MegaBACE ET 	terminator
14	ABI BigDye v1 	primer
15	ABI BigDye v1 	terminator
16	ABI BigDye v3 	primer
17	ABI BigDye v3 	terminator

=== Template name XbA36K22-14a08

Template name

=== Template score 0.900000

Template score. 1 is perfect (forward and reverse reading pairs confirming the 
expected template insert size, and all sequences accounted for).

=== Template direction - (1)

Can be "+" or "-". This just indicates if the forward reading is complemented
(-) or not (+).

=== Type Vector Primer walk

Experiment type chosen. After this comes the various experiment specific
details.

=== Primer sequence AGTCCTCTAGGTACACGAGTT
=== Primer position 290..310

Sequence of primer and position in the consensus.

=== Primer 2ndary=7.900000

Secondary match score computed from looking at other bits of sequence, vector, 
and any external screening databases (repeats and the like) - we want this
low. It weights sub-matches that extend to the 3' end higher as these have a
chance of initiating extension. Every base of match adds 0.5 to this score,
but the consecutive 3' end bases add 1.2, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7
respectively (ie additional weighting for the first 7 bases). These numbers
are mostly guess work, but also based on conversations with local users.

=== Primer score=1.727319, direction '-'

Mostly based on the primer3 objective function, but also with a very small
adjustment to take into account the chance of the primer being wrong due to an 
error in the consensus. (The adjustment is simply to promote use of primers in 
better quality regions when otherwise there is little to chose between choice
of primers.)

Primer3's scores are such that lower values are good.
