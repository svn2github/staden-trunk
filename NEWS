4 July 2005 (& more - add to this until new release)
===========

Gap4
----

* The join editor invoked from Find Read Pairs plot now brings up the
  editors at the start/end of the sequences forming the read-pair
  instead of the start/end of the two contigs.

* Search by sequence in the editor now finds consensus matches
  too. Also fixed some bugs where cutoff data matches were not always
  found and in some cases (reverse search) non-cutoff matches could be
  missed.

* The SNP Candidates plot now allows for the consensus to be saved
  directly from this window. The consensus and fake sequences added
  when a real split is requested now includes the "unsplit" readings
  from regions which apparently contained no SNPs (and therefore
  belong to all split contigs).

Trev
----

* Added a "-style pyro" option to request histogram based
  pyrosequencing data.

Io_lib
------

* Added "HASH=hashfile" component of RAWDATA search path along with
  hash_tar and hash_extract tools. These operate like index_tar but
  provide true fast random access into tar files (or other formats if
  needed).

* Major update of I/O mechanisms to use in-memory equivalents of the
  files being read from or written to. This has lead to some
  incompatibilities (see src/io_lib/CHANGES), but is also an order of
  magnitude faster in many cases.

Misc
----

* Removed some redundant old ABI utilities: getABIfloat, getABIhex,
  getABIraw, getABIstring. All of these can be achieved via getABIfield.

==========

Internal Sanger test version rel-1-6-0b3 ("gap4 -test")

Gap4
----

* Substantial modifications to the gap4 I/O mechanisms (balancing the
  "freetree"). The upshot of this is that the worst-case performance
  is now dramatically improved and the average performance will be
  slightly better too. Complementing a 10Mb contig dropped from about
  50 minutes to 1.5 minutes. Disassembling all readings (approx
  175000) in this database went from ~3 hours to 2.5 minutes.

* The contig editor "sequence sets" are now coloured to aid
  distinguishing.

* Fixed bugs with X11 BadDrawable crashes (I hope).

* Reverted the OLIGo tag back to using "serial=#" as the first line,
  although the additional information is still kept (albeit in a
  reduced precision format to make the tag shorter).

29 March 2005
=============

Internal Sanger test version rel-1-6-0b2 (the previous "gap4 -test")

Gap4
----

* Added 64-bit filesize support, meaning that Gap4 databases can now
  be larger than 2Gb in file size. Specify "-bitsize 64" to force
  64-bit mode, otherwise databases will still be created in the old
  32-bit format. Copy_db has a -b flag to change bitsize when copying
  databases so this aids in migration.

* A new experimental option "SNP candidates" (in the main view
  menu). Primarily designed for pulling apart the two alleles from
  mixed shotguns, it also has uses for exploring and sometimes
  resolving collapsed repeats. User feedback at this stage is most
  welcome.

* The consistency plots now distinguish between the old "discrepancy
  plot" (now named diploid discrepancy plot) and a new discrepancy
  plot that takes does not have the "two alleles only in 50/50 ratios"
  detector. This makes it more suitable for finding potential
  collapsed repeats.

* The contig editor now has the notion of "sets". A set is basically a
  sub-group of a contig, which is useful for exploring the outcome
  within a conti of pulling apart a collapsed repeat without actually
  doing it. The editor is automatically invoked in this manner by the
  SNP candidates output. This is largely experimental, but there are a
  number of potential ways to improve interaction. Ideas on a postcard
  please!

* Lots of speedups (primarily for the huge 64-bit databases):
  - Drawing of some consistency graphs;
  - Experiment file reading on large files (1000 fold on a 1Mb sequence);
  - Dealing with lists of contigs (eg "all contigs") is now O(N)
    complexity instead of O(N^2) (On databases with 50K contigs and
    2.6million reads this has changed some operations that would take
    hours to taking a couple of seconds);
  - (De)selecting contigs in the contig selector is now much much
    faster.

* Added auto-scrolling in the editor when dragging out selections
  wider than the screen width.

* Highlight disagreements in dots mode now uses ":" for bases that
  disagree but are below the quality threshold.

* Stop codon plot bug fixes. Removed the 10000 stop codons found
  limit; fixed stop codons at the ends of contig being drawn
  incorrectly (if beyond 'depadded' contig length).

* Fixed minor display bugs in various plots caused by rounding errors.
  This includes both the X coordinate for the consistency plots when
  multiple contigs are being shown at high zoom levels, and improved
  calculation of the second highest confidence value.

Misc
----

* Major speed up of readingl arge experiment files. On a 1Mb sequence
  with AV, ON and SQ lines the new code is 1000 times faster (tested
  on an Alpha)!

* Fixed pascal-style text string reading on AB1 files. This showed up
  as in the information section of trev (for example) where "730"
  instead of "3730" was listed as a model number.
