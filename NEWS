12th December 2005
==================

Gap4
----

* Find Internal Joins now ranks hits in the contig comparator by
  alignment score rather than percentage identity. This change does
  not alter the hits found; just their ordering.

* The Join Editor now as align left and align right buttons ("<" and
  ">" either side of "align"). These anchor one end of the alignment
  at the editor cursor position and allow the other end to move to
  accommodate padding. The old align button works as previously.

* Added an option to force the maximum number of groups formed in the
  SNP Candidates window, even if this means arbitrarily picking groups
  to merge. Also added protection against non-ACGT characters in sequences.

* Added a Save button to the "list" viewer/editor.

* The Contig Navigator window now has page-up and page-down
  keybindings and a new checkbutton to automatically display a
  selection of traces.

Misc
----

* Rewrote the startup scripts (gap4, spin, pregap4, trev, ...) to
  source staden.profile (only when appropriate) instead of duplicating
  much of the functionality there.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
15th November 2005
==================


Gap4
----

* Improved the SNP Candidates plot; it now generates consensus
  sequence per template when trying to identify candidate snps, rather
  than simply throwing out locations where conflicts exist within a
  template.

* Shuffle pads now has a configurable "band size" parameter. Also
  fixed a tag corruption bug in it.

* The contig editor shuffle pads command is back in a minimal form. It
  turns out that people rather liked its ability to remove entire
  columns of pads, so that particular feature of it is available once
  more.


io_lib
------

* Added append_sff program for merging 454's SFF archives.

* Various bug fixes with the mFILE support.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
20th October 2005
=================

Internal Sanger test version rel-1-6-0 ("gap4 -test")
(Ok so it's slightly newer than the official 1.6.0..)

Gap4
----

* SNP Candidates now has a 'correlation offset' parameter. This
  modifies the average correlation score required to give a positive
  impact on the edge scores.

io_lib
------

* Complete rewrite of the SFF format handling and replaced TVF with
  SFF archvies. New programs to manipulate SFF archives too: hash_sff
  and append_sff. Sorted and hash indices are supported in SFF archives.

* Added SFF= format for the RAWDATA search path.

* Allow archive/entry for use with SFF, TAR and HASH.
  Eg "extract_seq foo.tar/xyzzy.ztr" will work without setting
  RAWDATA.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
30th September 2005
===================

Version 1.6.0 tagged

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

27th September 2005
===================

Gap4
----

* Renamed the discrepancy plot to be second highest confidence plot.

* Fixed some (apparently rare) find internal joins crashes.

* Added a minimum quality slider to the Report Mutations "by
  differences" mode. Also fixed crashes and missing pictures in the
  HTML report.

io_lib
------

* Changed the HashFile format and updated it to be official version
  1.00.

  The key difference is that there's now a footer pointing back into
  the hashfile header allowing for the index to simply be appended to
  a (e.g. tar) archive.

* Improved handling of 454 data in ZTR; it no longer attempts to
  compress raw pyrosequencing data as this was not working well.

* Fixed Bug ID 1289095 (file descriptor leak).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th August 2005
================

Gap4
----

* Rewrote the Shuffle Pads algorithm to be more like ReAligner. It can
  introduce new pads and remove old ones as necessary in order to
  optimise the alignments. It has also moved from inside the contig
  editor to part of the main menu so that it can be scripted easier.

* The join editor invoked from Find Read Pairs plot now brings up the
  editors at the start/end of the sequences forming the read-pair
  instead of the start/end of the two contigs.

* Search by sequence in the editor now finds consensus matches
  too. Also fixed some bugs where cutoff data matches were not always
  found and in some cases (reverse search) non-cutoff matches could be
  missed.

* The SNP Candidates plot now allows for the consensus to be saved
  directly from this window. The consensus and fake sequences added
  when a real split is requested now includes the "unsplit" readings
  from regions which apparently contained no SNPs (and therefore
  belong to all split contigs).

* Report Mutations bug fix. Producing HTML output now works (albeit
  with less content) when asking for SNPs to be derived from
  "differences" instead of tags.

Trev
----

* Pyrosequencing data (eg 454 flowgrams) are now supported. Trev
  auto-senses the type and views accordingly. Added format for 454's
  SFF standard too.

Io_lib
------

* New release - 1.9.0. No longer uses libtool in configuration.

* Added "HASH=hashfile" component of RAWDATA search path along with
  hash_tar and hash_extract tools. These operate like index_tar but
  provide true fast random access into tar files (or other formats if
  needed).

* Major update of I/O mechanisms to use in-memory equivalents of the
  files being read from or written to. This has lead to some
  incompatibilities (see src/io_lib/CHANGES), but is also an order of
  magnitude faster in many cases.

Spin
----

* Under MS Windows spin and EMBOSSwin should coexist happily to the
  extent that Spin will spot the EMBOSSwin installation and use it.

Pregap4
-------

* Fixed various space-in-pathname bugs (most prevalent on MS Windows).


Misc
----

* Removed some redundant old ABI utilities: getABIfloat, getABIhex,
  getABIraw, getABIstring. All of these can be achieved via getABIfield.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 May 2005
==========

Internal Sanger test version rel-1-6-0b3 ("gap4 -test")

Gap4
----

* Substantial modifications to the gap4 I/O mechanisms (balancing the
  "freetree"). The upshot of this is that the worst-case performance
  is now dramatically improved and the average performance will be
  slightly better too. Complementing a 10Mb contig dropped from about
  50 minutes to 1.5 minutes. Disassembling all readings (approx
  175000) in this database went from ~3 hours to 2.5 minutes.

* The contig editor "sequence sets" are now coloured to aid
  distinguishing.

* Fixed bugs with X11 BadDrawable crashes (I hope).

* Reverted the OLIGo tag back to using "serial=#" as the first line,
  although the additional information is still kept (albeit in a
  reduced precision format to make the tag shorter).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

29 March 2005
=============

Internal Sanger test version rel-1-6-0b2 (the previous "gap4 -test")

Gap4
----

* Added 64-bit filesize support, meaning that Gap4 databases can now
  be larger than 2Gb in file size. Specify "-bitsize 64" to force
  64-bit mode, otherwise databases will still be created in the old
  32-bit format. Copy_db has a -b flag to change bitsize when copying
  databases so this aids in migration.

* A new experimental option "SNP candidates" (in the main view
  menu). Primarily designed for pulling apart the two alleles from
  mixed shotguns, it also has uses for exploring and sometimes
  resolving collapsed repeats. User feedback at this stage is most
  welcome.

* The consistency plots now distinguish between the old "discrepancy
  plot" (now named diploid discrepancy plot) and a new discrepancy
  plot that takes does not have the "two alleles only in 50/50 ratios"
  detector. This makes it more suitable for finding potential
  collapsed repeats.

* The contig editor now has the notion of "sets". A set is basically a
  sub-group of a contig, which is useful for exploring the outcome
  within a conti of pulling apart a collapsed repeat without actually
  doing it. The editor is automatically invoked in this manner by the
  SNP candidates output. This is largely experimental, but there are a
  number of potential ways to improve interaction. Ideas on a postcard
  please!

* Lots of speedups (primarily for the huge 64-bit databases):
  - Drawing of some consistency graphs;
  - Experiment file reading on large files (1000 fold on a 1Mb sequence);
  - Dealing with lists of contigs (eg "all contigs") is now O(N)
    complexity instead of O(N^2) (On databases with 50K contigs and
    2.6million reads this has changed some operations that would take
    hours to taking a couple of seconds);
  - (De)selecting contigs in the contig selector is now much much
    faster.

* Added auto-scrolling in the editor when dragging out selections
  wider than the screen width.

* Highlight disagreements in dots mode now uses ":" for bases that
  disagree but are below the quality threshold.

* Stop codon plot bug fixes. Removed the 10000 stop codons found
  limit; fixed stop codons at the ends of contig being drawn
  incorrectly (if beyond 'depadded' contig length).

* Fixed minor display bugs in various plots caused by rounding errors.
  This includes both the X coordinate for the consistency plots when
  multiple contigs are being shown at high zoom levels, and improved
  calculation of the second highest confidence value.

Misc
----

* Major speed up of readingl arge experiment files. On a 1Mb sequence
  with AV, ON and SQ lines the new code is 1000 times faster (tested
  on an Alpha)!

* Fixed pascal-style text string reading on AB1 files. This showed up
  as in the information section of trev (for example) where "730"
  instead of "3730" was listed as a model number.
