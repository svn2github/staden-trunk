@cindex assembly problems: breaking contigs
@cindex assembly problems: removing readings
@cindex assembly problems: disassembling readings

After assembly, and prior to editing, it can be useful to examine the
quality of the alignments between individual readings and the
sections of the consensus which they overlap. This may
reveal doubtful joins between sections of contigs, poorly aligned
readings, or readings that have been misplaced. By using this analysis
in combination with other gap5
functions 
such as Find internal joins (_fpref(FIJ, Find Internal
Joins, fij)) and Find repeats (_fpref(Repeats, Find Repeats,
repeats)), 
it is also possible to discover if 
readings have been positioned in the
wrong copies of repeat elements. 

If readings are found to be misplaced
or need removing for other reasons, gap5 has functions
for breaking contigs
(_fpref(Break Contig, Breaking Contigs, disassembly)),
and removing readings
(_fpref(Disassemble, Disassembling Readings, disassembly)).
These functions can be accessed through the main gap5 Edit menu or from
within the Contig Editor.

If readings are removed from contigs to start new contigs of one
reading, these contigs can then be processed by Find internal joins 
(_fpref(FIJ, Find Internal
Joins, fij)) 
and the Join editor
(_fpref(Editor-Joining, The Join Editor, contig_editor)), which should
reveal all the other positions at which the reading matches.

@section Removing Readings and Breaking Contigs

Occasionally contigs require more drastic changes than simple basecall
edits. Sometimes it is necessary
to remove readings that have been put in the wrong
place, or to break contigs that should not have been joined. Gap5
contains functions to help with these problems, and two
types of interface. 

If a contig
needs to be broken cleanly into two new contigs, with all the readings,
other than the two at the incorrect join, still linked together, then
Break Contig 
(_fpref(Break Contig, Breaking Contigs, disassembly)), or
(_fpref(Editor-Comm-Break Contig, Break Contig, contig_editor))
should be used. The former interface is available via the main gap5 Edit
menu, and the latter as an option in the Contig Editor.

If one or more readings need removing from from contig(s), even if their
removal will break the contiguity of a contig, then
(_fpref(Disassemble, Disassemble Readings, disassembly)), or
(_fpref(Editor-Comm-Remove Reading, Remove Reading, contig_editor))
should be used. The former interface is available via the main gap5 Edit
menu, and the latter as an option in the Contig Editor. Readings can be
removed from the database completely, or moved to start individual new
contigs, one for each reading.

@node Break Contig
@subsection Breaking Contigs
@cindex Break contig

The Break Contig function (which is available from the gap5 Edit menu)
enables contigs to be broken by removing the
link between two adjacent readings. The
user defines the contig coordinate to break at. All sequences starting
to the right of that position will be placed into a new contig.

@node Disassemble
@subsection Disassembling Readings
@cindex Disassemble readings
@cindex Removing readings

This function is used to remove readings from a database or move
readings to new contigs.

If readings are removed from the database all reference to them is
deleted. If a reading is moved to a ``single-read contig'' a new
contig will be created containing this one single reading, which may
then be re-processed by Find Internal Joins
(_fpref(FIJ, Find Internal Joins, fij)) 
and the Join editor
(_fpref(Editor-Joining, The Join Editor, contig_editor)), which should
reveal all the other positions at which the reading matches.

More useful is the general ``Move readings to new contigs''. This will
keep any assembly relationships intact between the set of readings to
be disassembled. For example if three readings overlap then when
disassembled all three will end up in a single new contig. This
function is particularly useful for pulling apart false joins or
repeats.

The set of readings to be processed can be read from a ``file'' or a ``list'' and
clicking on the ``browse'' button will invoke an appropriate browser. If just a
single reading is to be assembled choose ``single'' and enter the
reading name instead of the file or list of filenames.

Removal via a ``list'' is a particularly powerful option when
controlled via the list generation functions within the contig
editor. For example break contig could be viewed as disassembling a
list of readings selected using ``Select this reading and all to
right''.

Unlike gap4, gap5 can cope with having holes in contigs. (This is
obviously a requirement when dealing with mapped alignments.)  Hence
gap5 gives us a choice whether to break contigs into two (or more)
pieces when removing sequences produces holes in the contigs. By
default this is enabled.
