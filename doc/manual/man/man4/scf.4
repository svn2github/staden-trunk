scf \- SCF File Format

.SH "SCF"
.PP

SCF format files are used to store data from DNA sequencing
instruments. Each file contains the data for a single reading and
includes: its trace sample points, its called sequence, the positions
of the bases relative to the trace sample points, and numerical
estimates of the accuracy of each base. Comments and "private data"
can also be stored. The format is machine
independent and the first version was described in Dear, S and Staden, R. "A
standard file format for data from DNA sequencing instruments", DNA
Sequence 3, 107-110, (1992). 

Since then it has undergone several important changes. The first allowed for
different sample point resolutions. The second, in response to the need to
reduce file sizes for large projects, involved a major reorganisation of the
ordering of the data items in the file and also in the way they are
represented.  Note that despite these changes we have retained the original
data structures into which the data is read. Also this reorganisation in
itself has not made the files smaller but it has produced files that are more
effectively compressed using standard programs such as gzip. The io library
included in the package contains routines that can read and write all the
different versions of the format (including reading of compressed files). The
header record was not affected by this change. This documentation covers both
the format of scf files and the data structures that are used by the io
library. Prior to version 3.00 these two things corresponded much more
closely.

.SS "Header Record"
.PP

The file begins with a 128 byte header record that describes the
location and size of the chromatogram data in the file. Nothing is
implied about the order in which the components (samples, sequence and
comments) appear. The version field is a 4 byte character array
representing the version and revision of the SCF format. The current
value of this field is "3.00".

For versions of SCF files 2.0 or greater (\fBHeader.version\fP is `greater
than' "2.00"), the version number, precision of data, the uncertainty code set
are specified in the header.  Otherwise, the precision is assumed to be 1
byte, and the code set to be the default code set.  The following uncertainty
code sets are recognised (but still ignored by our programs!).

.SS "Sample Points."
.PP

The trace information is stored at byte offset
\fBHeader.samples_offset\fP from the start of the file. For each
sample point there are values for each of the four bases.  
\fBHeader.sample_size\fP holds the
precision of the sample values. The precision must be one of "1"
(unsigned byte) and "2" (unsigned short). The sample points need not be
normalised to any particular value, though it is assumed that they
represent positive values. This is, they are of unsigned type.

With the introduction of scf version 3.00, in an attempt to produce
efficiently compressed files, the sample points
are stored in A,C,G,T order; i.e. all the values for base A, followed by all
those for C, etc. In addition they are stored, not as their original 
magnitudes, but in terms of the
differences between successive values. The C language code used to
transform the values for precision 2 samples is shown below.

    /* If job == DELTA_IT:
     *  change a series of sample points to a series of delta delta values:

     *  then: delta_delta = delta - previous_delta
     * else

.SS "Sequence Information."
.PP

Information relating to the base interpretation of the trace is stored
at byte offset Header.bases_offset from the start of the file. 
Stored for each base are: its
character representation and a number (an index into the Samples data
structure) indicating its position within the trace. The relative
probabilities of each of the 4 bases occurring at the point where the
base is called can be stored in \fBprob_A\fP , \fBprob_C\fP ,
\fBprob_G\fP and \fBprob_T\fP.

From version 3.00 these items are stored in the following order: all
"peak indexes", i.e. the positions in the sample points to which the
bases corresponds; all the accuracy estimates for base type A, all for
C,G and T; the called bases; this is followed by 3 sets of empty int1
data items. These values are read into the following data structure by
the routines in the io library.

The private data section is provided to store any information required
that is not supported by the SCF standard. If the field in the header
is 0 then there is no private data section. We impose no restrictions
upon the format of this section. However we feel it maybe a good idea
to use the first four bytes as a magic number identifying the used
format of the private data.

The SCF format version 3.00 has been designed with file compression in mind.
No new information is recorded when compared to the version 2.02 format,
except the data is stored in a manner conducive to efficient compression.

Experimentation @footnote{Analysed using a data set of 100 ABI (and their SCF
equivalent) files} has shown that 16 bit SCF version 3.00 files can achieve a
9:1 compression ratio and 8 bit SCF files a 14.5:1 compression ratio. These
figures are for SCF files without quality values compressed using the
\fBbzip\fP utility. \fBgzip\fP tends to give between 20 to 40% larger files
than \fBbzip\fP. Compressed SCF files containing accuracy values tend to be
around 10% larger than those without accuracy values.

Whilst compression is not a specific part of the SCF standard, the size of
trace files and the compression ratios attainable suggests that it is wise to
handle compressed files. The Staden Package utilities, such as gap4 and trev,
automatically uncompress and compress SCF files as needed.

Note that at present, on the fly compression, as just described, is not
implemented for the Windows version of the package.
