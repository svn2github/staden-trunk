@cindex hash_exp: man page
@unnumberedsec NAME

hash_exp --- produces an index for a file of concatenated experiment files.

@unnumberedsec SYNOPSIS

@code{hash_exp} @i{exp_archive}

@unnumberedsec DESCRIPTION

@code{hash_exp} adds a hash-table index on to the end of a
concatenated file of experiment files. It's purpose is simply to
provide random access to experiment files while also reducing the
number of separate disk files.

The @code{hash_list} program will list the contents of the hashed
archive. The entry names stored in the archive are taken from the
@code{ID} lines in the experiment files rather than their original
filenames.

Within Gap4 you can assemble a hashed experiment file archive and it will
automatically assemble all files within it. For finer grain control
use @code{hash_list} to produce a file of filenames and then edit this
accordingly before supplying it as a ``fofn'' to gap4. In this case
you will also need to configure Gap4 to set the @code{EXP_PATH}
environment variable to contain @code{HASH=}@i{exp_archive_filename}.
