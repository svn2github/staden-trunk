_split()
@node Complement
@section Complement a Contig

This function 
(which is available from the gap4 Edit menu)
is used to complement a contig, which means that it will
complement and reverse all its readings and reorder them to produce a
contig with the opposite orientation. It operates on a single contig
selected via a dialogue box.

_split()
@node Enter Tags
@section Enter Tags
@cindex tags: entering from a file
@cindex entering tags from file
@cindex annotations: entering from a file
@cindex entering annotations from file


This routine 
(which is available from the gap4 Edit menu)
is used to add a set of tags (_fpref(Intro-Anno, Annotation
readings and contigs, gap4)) stored in a file, to the database. The file
format (see below) is identical to the output produced by the "save tags to
file" option of "Find Repeats". _fxref(Repeats, Find Repeats, repeats) The
format is a subset of the experiment file format. _fxref(Formats-Exp,
Experiment Files, formats) The two are close enough for Enter tags to use an
experiment file as input. The only input required is the name of the file to
read and a file browser can be used to aid its selection.

Note that "Enter tags" will remove any results plotted in the Contig 
Comparator.

The start of a typical file is shown below.

@example
CC   Repeat number 0, end 1
ID   zf48g3.s1
TC   REPT b 1031..1072
TC        Repeats with contig zf48g3.s1, offset 957
CC   Repeat number 0, end 2
ID   zf48g3.s1
TC   REPT b 957..998
