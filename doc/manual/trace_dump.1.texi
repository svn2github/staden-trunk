@cindex trace_dump: man page
@unnumberedsec NAME

trace_dump --- lists in a textual form the contents of a trace file.

@unnumberedsec SYNOPSIS

@code{trace_dump} @i{file}

@unnumberedsec DESCRIPTION

@code{trace_dump} extracts the contents of a trace file and lists it
in textual format. It is primarily a debugging tool for use with
io_lib, but can serve as a useful way to query the contents of a trace
file outside of graphical programs such as Trev. The @i{file} may be of
any supported trace format (and so this tool replaces the older
@code{scf_dump} program).

Each portion of the trace file is listed in its own block. The block
names output are ``[Trace]'' (containing general information such as
the number of samples), ``[Bases]'', ``[A_Trace]'', ``[C_Trace]'',
``[G_Trace]'', ``[T_Trace]'' and ``[Info]'' (containing the free text
comments).
