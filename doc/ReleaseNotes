			Staden Package v1.5.3
			=====================
(aka 2004.1).

The is a general new-features and bug-fix release of the Staden
Package. There are no massive changes, but I hope you'll find the
updates useful still. Windows users may find a larger difference as
the previous release was not build on that platform; please read the
1.4 release notes too.

This release also includes much needed updates to the
documentation. It is provided in PDF format; if you wish to obtain the
old PostScript format we previously provided please use the Acrobat
(or similar) tools.

For the full list of bug fixes and gory details of all files changed,
please see the ChangeLog. Here is a summary of new features or
improvements:


Gap4
====

*	New plot: 2nd-highest confidence. This plot shows next highest
	confident base per consensus location. (This plots the same as
	the contig editor "consensus discrepancy" search.)

*	New plot: discrepancies. Much like the 2nd-highest confidence,
	but with some added statistics to compute the likelihood of
	this position containing two different sequences.

*	New command List Base Confidence on View menu. This tabulates
	base call confidence values along with their agreement or
	disagreement with the consensus. This is a useful measure for
	the amount of variations within an assembly (whether they are
	real SNPs or assembly errors).

*	Added a "Join To..." menu to the contig editor names
	panel. This brings up the join editor based on read-pair
	linkage between contigs.

*	New editor search mode - by consensus discrepancy. Unlike the
	normal discrepancy search, this finds locations where the
	consensus scores computed from each base-types in turn
	indicate a problem.

*	Mousewheel support has been added to the Y-scrolling of the
	contig editor and trace displays.

*	New function: "quality clip contig ends" to trim back low
	quality data off the end of contigs. The purpose is to correct
	for phrap assemblies where clipping is typically done based on
	disagreements, and disagreements at the very end when depth=1
	do not happen. This leads to 'rubbish' being at the contig
	end, devaluing the FIJ with "hidden data" turned off.

*	The editor reference sequence will now always be shown at the
	top of the editor.

*	When auto-diff traces is enabled, the editor will
	automatically pick wild-type traces to compare against if none
	have been set.

*	Improved the Y-scaling for auto-diff. It is now beneficial to
	enable!

*	Added a setting in the editor to automatically bring up
	read-pairs of traces. That is, if a forward strand sequence is
	clicked on and it overlaps with the reverse strand, then both
	traces are shown.

*	Tags may now contain simple GUIs in place of the text
	panel. The GUI is based around the Spin ACD (Emboss) code and
	so is a bit complex to describe. If there is sufficient
	interest please contact me (jkbonfield) and I will post a
	writeup on them.

*	Added new template status codes to the contig editor. E
	indicates that the template is consistent, but an "E"nd is
	missing (ie it is not a read-pair). O indicates that both ends
	are present, but one is in an"O"ther contig. The only
	"D"istance flag has now be split into "D" and "d" to
	distinguish between too big/small versus impossible.
 
*	The "Sequence Search" function now searches finds matches in
	padded sequence when using the "by tags" mode. Matches
	displayed in the editor are now automatically selected to
	speed up tagging.

*	Added an option to control the maximum alignment length displayed
	from find internal joins (in the text output window).

*	Added some rudimentary checking for multiple gap4s writing to
        the same database. One gap4 should now abort (instead of
        corrupting the database).

*	Added a new option to allow the highlight disagreements	mode
	to be filtered by base quality. 

*	Ambiguity codes can now be written to FASTA files when
	saving the consensus.

*	Added a template-size strictness option (in both the main
	Options menu and the template display menus) to adjust the
	leeway allowed in the minimum/maximum insert size information.

*	Improved handling of pads in the restriction enzyme plots
	(sizes listed are correct for padded sequences) and stop codon
	plots (pads are ignored and no longer cause reading frame
	shifts).

*	Very short sequencing vector tags may now be ignored when
	computing the validity of templates, as such tags are
	typically erroneous.

*	Added the ability to filter out certain types of primer
	information when computing the consistency of templates. This
	allows workarounds for invalid PR details in the experiment
	files.

*	Directed assembly now has the option to ignore vector-clip
	tags (SL/SR) in the experiment files. This means that vector
	tags in non-hidden data do not change the assembly when
	exporting and reassembling the data.

*	Added a "Prev" button to the contig editors Select Primer
	interface.

*	The editor names display can now be adjusted to show template
	names instead of reading names (see the editor Settings menu).

*	The contig editor now remembers the last used X-scrollbar
	position for the names panel when restarting.


Prefinish
=========

*	Sequences containing a "FAKE" note are now ignored when
	computing strand coverage.

*	Decreased the impact of primer3 scores on the experiment
	"cost".

*	Added options for checking template status
	(-chk_template_stat) and to allow ignoring certain classes of
	errors.

*	Added a -min_vector_len parameter so very small (and hence
	likely wrong) vector tags are ignored.


Other
=====

*	New command-line tool "getABIfield". This is a generic tool
	for dumping contents of AB1 files in a variety of formats.

*	Convert_trace -normalise has been rewritten. It generally does
	a much better job now. It also has a "-subtract" option to
	remove fixed DC offsets from traces.
