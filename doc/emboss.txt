Setting up EMBOSS for use with Spin
===================================

The create_emboss_files program attempts to find the location for your
installed EMBOSS release. From this is iterates through all of the acd files
and produces tcl/tk GUIs for each program. These are placed in the
$STADENROOT/lib/spin_emboss/acdtcl directory. An Emboss menu is added to Spin, 
with the menu specification being in $STADENROOT/tables/emboss_menu.

An example EMBOSS setup is distributed with the Staden Package. This was built 
from the EMBOSS-2.0.0 release, but most of it is likely to work with newer
versions, except obviously where new programs are added.

Note that the dialogues created may be very large (as is the case with showseq 
for example). However the ACD files we used were modified by adding
appropriate section: and endsection: keywords. This means that some of the
EMBOSS dialogues in Spin have multiple "tabs". (In time these will make their
way in to the official EMBOSS releases.)
