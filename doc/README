Rebuilding documention
======================

For this you'll need multiple dependencies, including:

    bourne shell
    sed/awk/grep
    perl
    tcl
    texinfo
    TeX (eg "tetex-bin" package)
    emacs (for texinfo mode)
    m4
    imagemagick

There are two versions of the manual, one for unix and one for
windows, although they are very similar. You will need to either type
"make unix" or "make windows" depending on which set of documentation
you wish to build.

You may also wish to redefine PAPER in the makefile. By default we
build A4, but PAPER=us will use US letter format instead. Eg:

      make unix PAPER=us

Note that rebuilding the main manual subdirectory only works well from
a clean directory. This is a long-standard bug, but it can be worked
around by typing "(cd manual; make spotless)".


Installing documention
======================

Use "make install prefix=<dir>" to install the package documentation
somewhere. This is entirely platform independent, so the documentation
will be copied to ${prefix}/share/man/ and ${prefix}/share/doc/staden/.

This copies manuals previously been built in the first step.

Without redefining the prefix variable the documentation will attempt
to be installed into the system "/usr" directory. prefix defined here
should be the same --prefix used when configuring and building the
main Staden Package source directory.

Additionally, the DESTDIR variable can be set allowing for staged
installs. See http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html
for further details on this.


Building a source distribution
==============================

If you've edited the manual and wish to rebuild a new documentation
"source" package, the command is "make distsrc".

This will create a staden-<version>-doc.tar.gz file.
