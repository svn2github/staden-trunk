These notes are the basis of a two day practical course on the use of the
Staden Package for handling DNA sequencing projects. These courses are
organised and run at several sites by David Judge from Cambridge University,
and James Bonfield, one of the Package developers. The course includes
additional lectures and demonstrations but even without these, if you can bear
the dreadful humour, these notes and the practical exercises they describe,
provide an excellent introduction to the use of the programs.  David and James
are easily persuaded to run the course at new sites, especially in exotic
locations which have not previously had that pleasure.
