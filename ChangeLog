	INTERNAL RELEASE rel-1-7-3

2008-11-13  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/g/g-request.c,
	* src/g/g-io.c:
	More int vs size_t/off_t changes to handle large .aux files.

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tman_display.c,
	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c,
	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	Handle 454 traces where the sequence aligned against the trace is
	(for read-pair data) just a portion of the entire trace. This
	involves removing assumptions of origpos(xx,seq,1) being the first
	trace coordinate.
	

2008-11-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Misc/array.c,
	* src/Misc/array.h:
	(11:39:05) Updated dimensions to be of type size_t so we can
	allocate arrays larger than 2Gb. 

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(11:39:58) Use off_t instead of int in expressions involving lseek.
	This fixes a bug where .aux index files larger than 2Gb would fail. 

2008-11-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tgap/BAF,
	* src/tgap/Makefile,
	* src/tgap/baf.c,
	* src/tgap/baf.h,
	* src/tgap/tg_index.c:
	(15:09:12) Added (some) support for BAF - the basic assembly
	format. This isn't intended to be a long-term file format but it
	will serve as a working format until a strong contender emerges.
	For now it's a replacement CAF to work around our current woes. 

	* src/tgap/hache_table.c,
	* src/tgap/hache_table.h:
	(15:09:30) Added iterators to the HacheTable code. 

	* src/tgap/tg_iface_g.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_sequence.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_sequence.h,
	* src/tgap/tg_struct.h:
	(15:11:12) Added trace_name to the sequence_t struct and a flag to
	indicate if the field is present on disk. This allows us to add
	explicit trace names only for cases where it differs to the
	sequence name. 

	* src/tgap/tg_view.c:
	(15:11:29) Fixed a bug with long read names where they could
	overlap the sequence. 

	* src/gap5/Makefile:
	(15:12:13) Fixed Makefile to not use ~jkb/work/tgap for the tgap
	source - it now correctly uses the Staden local copy. Oops 

	* src/gap5/trace_display.tcl:
	(15:12:55) Protect against trace titles containing dots, which
	previously broke the tk pathnames being generated. 

2008-10-24  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap5/consensus.c:
	(09:05:18) Added depth to the consensus struct per base.
	
	Improved support for utilising all 4 confidence values when
	available.
	
	Bug fixed some edge cases, such as zero depth regions. 

	* src/gap5/consensus.h:
	(09:05:31) Added depth to the consensus struct per base. 

	* src/gap5/contig_editor.tcl:
	(09:06:24) The status line updates quality information on keyboard
	cursor movements now as well as mouse over events. 

	* src/gap5/editor_view.c,
	* tables/gap5rc:
	(09:07:48) The editor "brief" status line format has been updated
	to support reporting all 4 confidence values for a sequence base
	call. 

	* src/gap5/gap4_compat.c:
	(09:08:23) contig_name_to_number now uses contig_index_query for
	btree scanning rather than a brute force search. 

	* src/gap5/newgap5_cmds.c:
	(09:10:06) New function: tcl_sequence_depth, doing pretty much what
	you expect.
	
	Start of tcl_find_internal_joins interface. Incomplete right now.
	
	tcl_calc_consensus_full now reports sequence depth too, incase
	you're already calculating the consensus anyway. 

2008-10-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_sff.c:
	(14:08:19) Added support for outputting only the table of contents
	to a new file without copying the existing sff files. This is
	useful if we have the original sff files in an archive that we
	cannot modify. 

	* src/tgap/b+tree2.c:
	(14:09:23) Additional error checking in btree_find_recurse(). 

	* src/tgap/tg_contig.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_contig.h:
	(14:09:50) Added a contig_index_query function, analogous to
	sequence_index_query. 

	* src/tgap/tg_iface_g.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_index.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_sequence.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_sequence.h,
	* src/tgap/tg_tcl.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_view.c:
	(14:29:43) Fixed bug in btree_load_cache. If it had an error
	locking or reading data then it freed an uninitialised pointer.
	
	Fixed a view locking bug in btree_write().
	
	Added support for SEQ_FORMAT_CNF4 encoded sequences. These have 4
	log-odds confidence values instead of the 1 phred value. 

2008-10-07  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am:
	(16:02:51) Added extract_fastq to the list of programs to build. 

2008-10-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tgap/Makefile,
	* src/tgap/ace.c,
	* src/tgap/ace.h,
	* src/tgap/maq.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_index.c:
	(16:12:13) Added support for loading (new format) ACE files in
	tg_index.
	
	For all formats we no longer flush the cache after every contig as
	this was a major speed hit when dealing with lots of small contigs.
	
	Added read-pairing support for the simple .aln format. If the name
	matches it's assumed to be part of a pair. 

	* src/tgap/hache_table.c:
	(16:13:07) Minor changes to the HacheTableStats function. The
	reporting number of cache hits/misses is now a delta from the last
	time the stats function was called. 

	* src/tgap/tg_tcl.c:
	(16:13:49) Added comments regarding usage. No code change. 

	* src/gap5/gap4_compat.c:
	(16:23:56) Fixes in get_contig_num. (Done so long ago I forget what
	the reasoning was - sorry!) 

	* src/gap5/fij.c,
	* src/gap5/fij.h,
	* src/gap5/fij.tcl,
	* src/gap5/newgap_structs.h:
	(16:25:46) Added Find Internal Joins function. 

	* src/gap5/depth.tcl,
	* src/gap5/tclIndex,
	* tables/gap5rc,
	* tables/gap5rc_menu_full:
	(16:26:50) Added the first draft of a read-depth and template
	display. Also tidied up the menus to remove most of the unused
	functions somewhat. 

	* src/tgap/ace_reorder.pl:
	(17:00:02) This attempts to reorder an ACE file so that the reads
	within it are sorted in left to right order.
	
	The purpose for this is to improve efficiency when converting to a
	Gap5 database. While it'll work regardless of the read order
	(provided the reads are presented in the same order as listed int
	he AF lines), it is inefficient if the reads for a small region are
	spread throughout a large area of disk. 

	* src/gap5/depth.tcl:
	(17:56:15) Removed broken bits from the entry dialogue. The window
	doesn't yet support multiple contigs anyway. 

2008-09-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_list.c:
	(14:00:22) Added new program: srf_list. This lists or counts the
	sequence names within an SRF file. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:
	(14:01:38) The srf_next_block_details now uses the trace_body
	struct held within the srf struct. This means it can be queried
	after a successful call and is utilised by srf_list to obtain the
	trace body size. 

2008-09-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(12:59:37) Fixed a bug with parsing the directory name. If it fails
	it left the run number in an inconsistent state.
	
	This shouldn't cause issues in production pipelines, but does if
	you copy the files out of the run folders. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h,
	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:33:45) Overhauled the SRF indexing code.
	
	Much of the indexing code in srf_index_hash.c has been moved over
	to srf.c so it can be used by other programs.  An API has been
	created too so it is now far easier to create, add to and save an
	index.
	
	Added support for writing indexes in illumina2srf. Note that now if
	no index is written we also write out 8 bytes of zero, indicating
	the length of the index is zero. (This is required by more recent
	versions of the SRF specification.)
	
	Still to do: tools such as srf_filter should be updating the index
	(or at least removing the old ones). This will now be easier to do
	with these code updates.
	
	Updated the tests to check the new illumina2srf -i option too. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_index_hash.c:
	(16:33:46) Overhauled the SRF indexing code.

2008-09-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am:
	(08:43:41) Updated for version number and inclusion of tests dir. 

	* src/io_lib/bootstrap,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(08:43:42) Updated for version number and inclusion of tests dir. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/Attic/Makefile.in:
	(08:43:55) Removed due to being auto-generated from Makefile.am 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/os.h:
	(08:44:56) Tidy up of endianness detection. I split apart the
	endian step from the os-components (no strdup, etc). Also changed
	the order so that when using autoconf the automatically detected
	settings override any existing assumptions from os.h. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/hash_table.h:
	(08:46:10) Included sys/types.h for off_t type. 

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES,
	* src/io_lib/ChangeLog,
	* src/io_lib/README:
	(10:25:27) Final tweaks for preparing 1.11.4 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h:
	(10:52:37) Changed block_type from char to int. This cures a
	problem on PowerMac (PPC) running Debian where char is by default
	an unsigned type, meaning it cannot be compared to EOF (-1). 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fasta.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fastq.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_extract_linear.c:
	(15:25:29) A variety of changes to make the code work correctly
	using msys/mingw on Windows. These mainly revolve around binary
	mode and nl/cr issues. 

	* src/io_lib/ChangeLog:
	(15:32:21) *** empty log message *** 

2008-09-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/acinclude.m4:
	(13:27:35) Fixed the LIBCURL_CHECK_CONFIG code to not believe the
	output from "curl-config --libs". We try -lcurl first off to see if
	that also works. The reason is simply that curl-config --libs
	typically loves to explicitly specify all the implicit
	dependencies, such as -lssl -lcrypto -ldl, etc. This in turn locks
	compiled io_lib libraries and binaries into requiring very specific
	version of system libraries. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/Attic/Makefile.in:
	(13:27:57) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/compression.c:
	(13:30:24) Minor speed tweaks to qshift and unqshift 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(13:31:41) Added include of io_lib_config.h for autoconf builds so
	that the ftello and similar functions get the correct prototypes. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h:
	(13:32:44) Made partial_decode_ztr non-static and added it, along
	with ztr_dup and construct_trace_name to the external header file
	for use in other parts of io_lib. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_filter.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_info.c:
	(13:36:40) Added two new programs from Steven Leonard.
	
	srf_info: dumps out basic information on the contents of an SRF    
	      file, including the read name prefixes used, how many	   
	  DBs per DBH and frequencies of ZTR chunk and meta-data	 
	strings.
	
	srf_filter: a tool to produce new srf files by filtering in or out 
		data from an existing srf file. This can be performed	   
	    either at the entire trace level (eg tagged as good or	   
	bad) or also at individual ZTR chunk levels (eg processed      
	data only). 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fasta.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(13:37:37) Include string.h for additional prototypes (for -Wall
	-Wno-paranthesis compilations). 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_extract_hash.c:
	(13:38:47) Major overhaul from Steven Leonard. It now supports a
	-fastq option to output fastq instead of ZTR files and optionally
	can use calibrated or non-calibrated confidence values too. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_extract_linear.c:
	(13:39:44) Added support for SRFB_NULL_INDEX so that srf files with
	a blank index do not causes crashes. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_index_hash.c:
	(13:40:44) Added extra error checking from Steven Leonard to spot
	duplicate read names. The new -c option also allows checking of an
	existing srf file without attempting to write a new index. 

2008-09-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(08:40:20) Fixed bug reported by Robert Sanders. The fwd matrix was
	being written twice on paired-end runs instead of fwd+reverse. 

	* src/io_lib/COPYRIGHT,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/open_trace_file.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/sff.c:
	(10:56:46) Updated 454's copyright notice (following correspondence
	from Jim Knight at 454) to explicitly include permission to modify
	and redistribute the code.
	
	Also updated the GRL licence to be explicit rather than just an
	implied BSD style. 

2008-08-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/deflate_interlaced.c:
	(09:00:39) Added external codes2codeset() function to turn
	bit-length arrays into codesets. Useful for tools that wish to use
	this code to use their own precomputed huffman trees. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/deflate_interlaced.h:
	(09:00:53) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:01:21) Renamed ILLUMINA_GA_PARAMS and ILLUMINA_GA_PARAMS2 to
	ILLUMINA_GA_BUSTARD_PARAMS and ILLUMINA_GA_FIRECREST_PARAMS. 

	* src/tgap/tg_cache.c:
	(09:01:56) Bug fixed the new flush code. Using ARR instead of arr
	macro auto-extends the array for us. 

	* src/tgap/tg_contig.c:
	(09:03:15) Added cache_incr/decr calls around contig_seqs_in_range2
	so that the recursive nature of the function cannot push the bin
	out of the cache. 

	* src/tgap/tg_tcl.c:
	(13:46:28) Overhauled the tcl objects somewhat. Contigs and
	sequence (more to follow) sport an "io" and a "delete" method. This
	comes about from the realisation that my object system doesn't
	really fit in with Tcl.
	
	Consider:
	
	if {$condition} {    set r [$io get_sequence $seq_num]	  puts
	length=[$r get_length] }
	
	This this we query the tg_cache to get a sequence object, we create
	a Tcl_Obj associated with that too (stored in $r) and register a
	*global* function named after the string form of $r. This allows us
	to call it with "$r get_length" as technically objects are not
	classes and cannot have methods invoked on them in their own right.
	The names are globally unique though so there are no clashes.
	
	Hence when $r goes out of scope it destroys the reference to the
	object but does not remove the function. We now have to explicitly
	call "$r delete" to tidy up otherwise we end up with memory leaks
	and global namespace pollution. ie:
	
	if {$condition} {    set r [$io get_sequence $seq_num]	  puts
	length=[$r get_length]	  $r delete }
	
	It's not enough to track reference counts on $r either as the act
	of calling it as a function ($r get_length) changes the type from
	sequence to cmdName, decrementing the reference. We cannot remove
	the memory yet though, so it's not possible to keep track it seems.
	
		   - -	- -  - -  - -  - -  - -  - -  - -  - -	- -
	
	Perhaps with hindsight we should use a procedural model instead:
	
	if {$condition} {    set r [g5::io::get_sequence $io $seq_num]	 
	puts length=[g5::seq::get_length $r] }
	
	This way we do not create and remove procedures plus our data
	automatically goes out of scope and is tidied up for us. The above
	is essentially what happens in perl when io is blessed to be in
	class g5::io or $r is blessed to be in class g5::seq. I guess
	incrTcl has an equivalent mechanism. 

	* src/gap5/gap.tcl:
	(14:58:13) Removed requirement of database name being
	"dbname.version". 

2008-08-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:07:09) Added the second .params file (Data directory).
	
	Major reduction in memory usage when adding the .params files; we
	only hold this in memory for the first ZTR file per DBH as it ends
	up in the header anyway. (This also speeds things up too.) 

	* src/tgap/tg_cache.c,
	* src/tgap/tg_gio.h:
	(13:28:23) Fixed the cache_flush code to hand over cache_items from
	a "derived" io to the base io struct before running cache_flush on
	the base.
	
	This ensures that the base io obtains copies of data from (for
	example) the contig editor. 

	* src/gap5/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap5/tkEditor.c:
	(13:30:43) Added an "edits_made" sub-command of the editor. This is
	used to implement a warning on editor exit to ask if changes should
	be saved.
	
	Also fixed an error with a callback when highlighting non-sequence
	objects in the names panel. 

2008-08-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tgap/tg_iface_g.c:
	(15:48:12) Added more automatic commiting of writes. I'm still not
	sure if this is correct behaviour, but given our caching is now
	held in the tg_cache layer instead of G library it serves the
	purpose. 

	* src/tgap/tg_tcl.c:
	(15:49:01) Added a "child" subcommand of the io type. 

	* src/gap5/Makefile:
	(15:49:22) Tidyup to support tgap library being part of the staden
	build system now. 

	* src/gap5/contig_editor.tcl:
	(15:50:59) Made the contig editor using a child io for editing in.
	The save button now works.
	
	(Previously save/exit did the same thing as we edited the live io
	instead of child io.) 

	* src/gap5/gap.tcl:
	(15:51:49) Minor tweaks to replace gap4 with gap5 in strings,
	functions and version (gap v5.00 now) 

	* src/gap5/tkEditor.c:
	(15:52:29) Added Editor class save sub-command. 

2008-08-19  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tgap/g-files.c:
	(15:10:36) Fix issues with .aux files being > 2Gb in size.

	(14:18:07) Initial import of tgap. This is for use in Gap5 source
	(which uses libtgap.so), but development on the test programs
	tg_index and tg_view will now take place in this CVS tree instead
	of Sanger's private SubVersion repository.

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(10:21:28) Fixed a bug in parse_4_float when handling strings with
	leading zeroes after the point, eg "17.04". Fortunately this is
	never triggered in the solexa data as it's always one single value
	after the decimal point. 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/os.h:
	(10:33:29) Applied Chris Saunders' patch to use autoconf for
	checking machine endianness. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:52:10) Added a MAX_READS_PER_DBH #define to solexa2srf
	(defaults at 10000) to reduce the maximum number of traces per tile
	we process between SRF data block headers. This helps reduce the
	maximum memory usage which is especially important on dense GA2
	runs where 200,000 clusters in a tile can be achieved.
	
	Also fixed a bug with using -qf/-qr when not supplying a list of
	tiles consecutively starting with tile 1. 

2008-08-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:
	(08:18:14) Fixed memory leak in srf_next_ztr reported by Rob Egan.
	Triggered by srf2fastq -C. 

2008-07-24  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:47:32) Updated version to v1.10
	
	Added -pf/-pr parameters to allow the phasing files to be stored.
	By default it attempts to derive these filenames from the fwd/rev
	cycle numbers.
	
	Auto-compute the basecaller name and version string from the
	directory name. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:58:15) Bug fix to get_base_caller() so that it can identify the
	directory when given a full pathname to elsewhere other than the
	cwd. 

2008-07-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:54:51) No longer iterate through tiles printing up . or !
	depending on whether we encounter an error. Now it just aborts at
	the point of failure.
	
	Also made the parsing code more robust as in a couple specific
	cases it only wrote to stderr without actually generating a
	non-zero exit code.
	
	These mean the tool is more amenable to running in a production
	pipeline. If it gets any error at all it'll be more obvious and
	forces attention. 

2008-07-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap5/consensus.c:
	(15:38:06) Fixes to the consensus algorithm for solexa reads -
	specifically calling gaps. 

	* src/gap5/contig_editor.tcl:
	(15:39:22) Added more use of tg_tcl's interfaces - we can now move
	reads around and insert/delete bases within readings (not just the
	consensus). 

2008-07-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:35:28) Updated the rounding of int/nse/sig2 to all use the
	rint() function to round to closest integer value. Previously
	int/nse rounded down and sig2 rounded closest. (Although the
	rounding on sig2 was via +/- 0.5 and so the half-way cases
	sometimes give different answers to the new code using rint()).
	
	It has a very minor impact overall, but it is now consistent. 

2008-07-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/mFILE.c:
	(13:54:59) Fixed a bug visible with "extract_seq -fasta_out -fofn f
	-output f.fasta" whereby only the last file was visible. This is
	due to the mFILE mechanism and an explicit fseek upon writing each
	file. Fixed this by using an extended freopen option ("wbx" instead
	of "wb") to override this feature. It's not ideal, but gets the job
	done - I hope. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/Read.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/mFILE.h:
	(13:55:00) Fixed a bug visible with "extract_seq -fasta_out -fofn f
	-output f.fasta" whereby only the last file was visible. This is
	due to the mFILE mechanism and an explicit fseek upon writing each
	file. Fixed this by using an extended freopen option ("wbx" instead
	of "wb") to override this feature. It's not ideal, but gets the job
	done - I hope. 

2008-07-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h:
	(13:22:57) Added SRFB_NULL_INDEX as an SRF block type. It's
	essentially type 0 and is defined to be 8 long (with 7 more zeros).
	The purpose is to transparently gloss over the 8-zeros that may be
	on the end of some files indicating a missing index block. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(13:34:40) MAJOR BUG FIX!
	
	Fixed a bug in reorder_ztr() whereby the sorted order of multiple
	chunks of the same chunk type were not "stable". The result of this
	is that 3 SMP4 chunks (say A, B, C) may end up sorted A, B, C with
	nchunks==9 and C, A, B with nchunks==15. Given that an optimisation
	means that we change the number of chunks depending on whether
	we've encoded HUFF chunks this causes a "corruption" in as far as
	the correct data is stored but with potentially an incorrect
	meta-data block for the first SMP4 chunk.
	
	See srf_fix.c to reverse this problem.
	
	Also added a warning regarding the -C option and -qf option. These
	are inherently incompatible (right now) as purity filtered data is
	not calibrated.
	
	Updated version to v1.8 

2008-06-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	INTERNAL RELEASE rel-1-7-2b
	
2008-06-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap5/consensus.c:
	(16:23:43) Improved the consensus algorithm to handle pads. For now
	all pads score a fixed amount and we compare them against bases
	(any type) also at a fixed score. Having done that we then compute
	the base-score from non-pad bases as before, factoring in the
	probability of the base even existing right at the end.
	
	These fixed costs of overcall/undercall are reasonable for solexa
	where such errors are due to PCR and not related to the data
	quality.
	
	For capillary data we need more work to pick appropriate costs. 

	* src/gap5/contig_editor.tcl:
	(16:29:06) Added keybinding to use the new contig insert and delete
	base method. (Used for inserting columns of pads.) 

2008-06-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(15:03:22) Fixed typo in error message. 

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(15:04:48) The IUB mode of the phred-style consensus algorithm no
	longer treats * as N. 

	* src/gap4/edCommands.c:
	(15:05:39) Added code to disable storing of editor undo information
	for "strip pads" on any contig longer than 100Kb. It's not the
	ideal solution, but is a workaround to prevent potentially enormous
	memory usage in certain situations. 

2008-06-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/RENZYM.4,
	* tables/RENZYM.ALL:
	(13:24:04) Added BfuCI as an alternative to Sau3AI 

2008-06-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fasta.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(10:44:23) Removed memory leaks from using ztr_find_chunks and not
	freeing the result. 

2008-06-04  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/docs/ZTR_format:
	(13:06:36) Added some text regarding *ideas* for version 2. These
	are not officially part of any stanard yet. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/compression.c:
	(13:06:54) Comment change only. 

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES,
	* src/io_lib/ChangeLog,
	* src/io_lib/README:
	(14:14:15) Doc updates 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(14:15:00) Bumped version to 1.11.2 

2008-06-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:
	(16:23:50) Applied bug fix from John Emhoff: srf_read_xml was
	incorrectly interpreting the XML length as the length of the XML
	string rather than the entire SRF block itself including header. It
	now agrees with srf_write_xml, which interpreted this correctly. 

2008-05-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap5/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap5/editor_view.c,
	* src/gap5/editor_view.h,
	* src/gap5/tkEditor.c:
	(14:22:00) Added code to support read-pair data. For now this is
	just the right mouse click in the editor's read name as a proof of
	concept.
	
	Fixed the "is the cursor visible?" code too so set X first, fixing
	an error in working out the Y display point. 

2008-05-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap5/consen.tcl:
	(16:25:11) Added code for Gap4's main output consensus function.
	Right now it's in simple mode only with no marking or masking.
	Formats supported are fastq and fasta, with experiment file to
	follow maybe. 

	* tables/gap5rc:
	(16:25:25) Added code for Gap4's main output consensus function.
	Right now it's in simple mode only with no marking or masking.
	Formats supported are fastq and fasta, with experiment file to
	follow maybe. 

	* src/gap5/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap5/editor_view.c,
	* src/gap5/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap5/tkEditor.h:
	(16:28:21) Added display of mapping quality to the read-name
	section. 

2008-05-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/docs/ZTR_format:
	(08:38:05) Documented TYPE meta-data for SMP4 and removed the
	comment about being mutually exclusive with SAMP.
	
	Added explanation of log-odds vs phred scales.
	
	Added CNF1 chunk type (how did I miss this before?). 

2008-05-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap5/consen.tcl,
	* src/gap5/consensus.c,
	* src/gap5/qual.tcl:
	(10:25:34) Implemented a new consensus algorithm using log-odds
	scores. 

	* src/gap5/consensus.h:
	(10:25:35) Implemented a new consensus algorithm using log-odds
	scores. 

	* src/gap5/Makefile:
	(10:26:40) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap5/contig_editor.tcl,
	* tables/gap5rc:
	(10:27:55) Changed the mouse highlight on bases to use
	BASE_BRIEF_FORMAT[12] instead of the READ_BRIEF_FORMAT format
	string. 

	* src/gap5/editor_view.c,
	* src/gap5/editor_view.h:
	(10:30:26) Make use of the new consensus algorithm, which gives
	quality values so we can now grey-scale the consensus too.
	
	Improved the "brief" status line support, adding a new
	edGetBriefCon for consensus status info too. 

	* src/gap5/qual.c,
	* src/gap5/tkEditor.c:
	(10:30:30) Make use of the new consensus algorithm, which gives
	quality values so we can now grey-scale the consensus too.
	
	Improved the "brief" status line support, adding a new
	edGetBriefCon for consensus status info too. 

	* src/gap5/newgap5_cmds.c:
	(10:32:08) Added in List Consensus Confidence and List Base
	Confidence functions (the latter still needs major bug fixes
	though). 

	* src/gap5/qualIO.c:
	(10:32:09) Added in List Consensus Confidence and List Base
	Confidence functions (the latter still needs major bug fixes
	though). 

	* src/gap5/gap.tcl:
	(10:32:44) Temporary hack to change maxseq until I update the code
	to automatically derive it. 

2008-05-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:
	(09:12:23) Fixed memory leak in construct_trace_name. (Patch from
	John Emhoff at Heliocos.) 

2008-05-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(13:08:34) Fixed floating point to integer rounding of trace data
	to round to closest instead of floor(value). 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h,
	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fasta.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fastq.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(14:13:15) Added changes from Camil Toma (albeit modified here and
	there) to incorporate the -C option to various tools. This allows
	for chastity filtered data to be stored in SRF, but tagged as being
	bad data. We then get the option to filter it on extraction
	instead. 

2008-05-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(14:25:53) Reverted the footer position change in encode_ztr() back
	(to the 20th February 2008) to taking out the meta-data into the
	header block too. Although this contains variable data (OFFS=value)
	it's the same for all members of a tile. 

2008-05-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/gap5rc,
	* tables/gap5rc_menu_full:
	(11:05:11) Initial Gap5 prototype checkin. This misses the tgap
	distribution still, which will be added to sourceforge soon. (It's
	currently locally in Sanger's SVN repository.)

2008-05-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/open_trace_file.c:
	(11:06:53) Sped up searching in SRF files by stripping off the
	directory name when calling srf_find_trace(). (It got to this
	before eventually, but only after searching various false
	combinations.)
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	--- io_lib/open_trace_file.c CVS:
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
	--- 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/os.h:
	(11:07:31) Minor change to prevent errors when compiling within the
	Staden Package. No impact for autoconf version. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:
	(11:08:18) Fixed bug in srf_find_trace that caused it to rarely
	fail to find a trace when querying the hash table. 

2008-05-06  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/docs/ZTR_format:
	(11:44:51) Fixed error in the pictoral diagram describing the magic
	number. (It is correct everywhere else.) 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/open_trace_file.c:
	(14:27:24) Added SRF interfaces to open_trace_file meaning we can
	now try specifying traces file fubar.srf/tname or
	TRACE_PATH=SRF=fubar.srf and tname. 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/ztr.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(15:35:36) Implemented Come Raczy's (Illumina) changes. These
	involved renaming the solexa2srf and srf2solexa tools to be
	illumina2srf and srf2illumina and the addition of qcal support in
	preparation for the GA v1.0 release.
	
	Note that currently the filenames are the same as before, in order
	to preserve change history. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(15:43:33) Added srf.o to the Staden Package Makefile (NB: not part
	of the autoconf system.) 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(16:51:50) Fixed displaying of solexa style stick-plots. Negative
	values display correctly now and we also recalculate the proper
	baseline. 

2008-04-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/hash_table.c:
	(15:09:41) Initialises pb and pc in hash() function when using
	HASH_FUNC_JENKINS3. Bug reported by Cristian Goina. 

2008-04-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:22:33) Fixed a code inefficiency when using -qf and -qr. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h:
	(16:16:55) Fixed bugs regarding binary format read_id suffixes,
	reported and mostly patched by Cristian Goina.
	
	The srf_trace_body_t struct now has a read_id_length field.
	
	The srf_construct_trace_body() function has an extra argument to
	pass in the length, or -1 if unknown (it'll use strlen then).
	
	New function srf_write_pstringb to write binary pstrings, avoiding
	the requirement for strlen(). 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:21:57) Added extra arg to srf_construct_trace_body call (see
	srf.c change log).
	
	Fixed a bug introduced in the recent efficiency improvements for
	-qf/-qr. These meant that many sequences were incorrectly skipped. 

2008-04-07  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(08:54:06) Increased the estimation of number of bytes per cycle in
	the allocation in get_sig(). 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:11:06) Fixed error that crept in when error checking was added
	to compress_chunk calls. Missing curly braces meant that some
	chunks were not compressed while other chunks got needless
	additional layers of compression. 

2008-04-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(15:57:06) The defaults for -N and -n are now using the same naming
	conventions used in Gerald during the fastq generation steps. To do
	this is looks at the run folder root directory name to get the run
	date, machine name and run number. (These are available for use as
	%d, %m and %r in the format strings.)
	
	Calibrated confidence values are now automatically included if the
	-qf or -qr parameters are used (specifying the fastq filename).
	Note this only works currently if the number of bases after
	calibration is the same as the number before. The calibrated
	confidence values are written in a CNF1 ztr chunk (in addition to
	the existing CNF4 chunk for uncalibrated values) and are rescaled
	to adhere to the phred scale (-10 * log10(1-P)).
	
	Added meta-data to the confidence chunks (CNF1 and CNF4) with a
	SCALE key. The value is either LO (log-odds) or PH (phred). This
	increases file size somewhat as it's written once per trace, but
	the long-term goal is to upgrade ZTR to support the ability to
	specific default meta-data keys/values. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(15:57:58) Added a -c option to output calibrated confidence values
	instead of uncalibrated ones.
	
	Plus additionally it should be able to handle multiple archives on
	the command line instead of a single one. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(17:00:28) Added support for using popen() to gzip -cd instead of
	using gzopen. The reason is that it's between 3 and 5 times faster
	doing that. I'm unsure why, but overall it sped up solexa2srf -r 3
	fold when the Firecrest data is gzipped. 

2008-04-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:14:45) Fixed the footer(aka body) position calculation so it
	works still on trace files containing no trace data at all. Ie
	solexa2srf -P. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:28:02) Added Camil Toma's (Broad) changes to support -mf and
	-mr paremeters. These provide finer grained control over the
	filenames of the forward and reverse matrices. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(09:29:04) Added Camil Toma's (Broad) changes to extract text files
	embedded in ZTR TEXT chunks. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(10:54:29) Added Camil Toma's (Broad) changes to srf_dump_all.
	These add multiple new features, increasing the source length 7
	fold. From his email:

	Comments regarding happy with code noted. We'll see if people find
	it useful and if not there's always the otion to back it out. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(10:56:06) Fixed bug reported by Cristian Goina (JCVI): we now use
	srf_open with mode "rb" instead of "r". This resolves an issue on
	Windows/DOS when dealing with binary data including ^Z characters
	being interpreted as EOF. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(11:05:25) Fixed missing newlines in the standard "dump" format. 

2008-03-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/hash_table.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_list.c:
	(09:45:07) Added more includes of io_lib_config.h to ensure 64-bit
	file support works correctly. 

2008-03-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:32:15) Fixed an error when passing in fully qualified
	pathnames. We now chdir() to the directory containing the seq.txt
	file and work from there.
	
	Also some functions involved in supporting fastq files with
	callibrated confidence values. This is unfinished and needs more
	work, specifically it doesn't do anything with the sequence/qual
	yet (just parses it) and the entire operation should probably work
	from the GERALD directory instead of the Bustard directory. Hence
	for now the -qf and -qr options are undocumented. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:53:32) Incorporated Come Razy's changes to solexa2srf, with a
	few modifications to adhere to C89 instead of C9X C standards.
	
	These add support for the new Illumina IPAR file format via the -I
	command line option. 

2008-02-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/acinclude.m4,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(14:10:53) Fixed autoconf build environment for Fedora. We no
	longer assume /usr/lib is a valid default for zlib, instead relying
	on either the compiler to find it or an explicit --with-zlib
	option.
	
	See SF bug 1898427

	roup_id=100316&atid=627058 

2008-02-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(10:13:52) Fixed a crash when haplo_snps finds some snps but
	they're all below the minimum score. 

2008-02-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(10:33:36) Altered the header/footer split for ZTR to stop just
	before the metadata part of a SMP4 chunk. Previously it was after
	this and just before the data, but now we can have multiple SMP4
	chunks in a single ZTR file this was breaking things. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(12:49:09) Removed the ztr2read conversion and operate directly on
	the ztr struct. This is now 25% faster. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fasta.c:
	(12:49:30) New program - trivially modelled on srf2fastq.c 

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES,
	* src/io_lib/ChangeLog,

	* src/io_lib/configure.in,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/Attic/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am:
	(14:06:15) Updated docs/versions in preparation for 1.11.0 release. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/compression.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/deflate_interlaced.c,

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(16:07:44) Updates to remove various warnings from gcc -Wall
	(mostly unused variables as I'm ignoring the suggest parenthesis
	winges). 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_extract.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_extract_hash.c:
	(16:38:37) #include fcntl.h for Windows in order to pick up
	_O_BINARY. 

	* src/io_lib/README:
	(16:39:25) *** empty log message *** 

2008-02-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/ztr.h:
	(16:53:52) Added ZTR_TYPE_REGN definition. We have no explicit code
	to implement this yet in ztr.c, but for now it's in solexa2srf. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:55:38) Added support for specifying the start coord for the 2nd
	read in a paired-read run (solexa2srf -2 <cycle.no.>). This also
	adds a REGN chunk to the ZTR file and stores the second matrix file
	too. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(16:56:39) Major overhaul to support raw data as well as processed
	data. Still to-do: write out .params and the two matrix files. 

2008-02-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:
	(10:05:54) Fixed memory leak in srf_read_trace_body usage. This was
	primarily visible from within srf_index_hash. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:
	(12:35:18) Added include of io_lib-config.h to ensure picking up
	the correct compiler definitions for 64-bit file size support. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_extract_hash.c:
	(12:35:19) Added include of io_lib-config.h to ensure picking up
	the correct compiler definitions for 64-bit file size support. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_index_hash.c:
	(12:35:20) Added include of io_lib-config.h to ensure picking up
	the correct compiler definitions for 64-bit file size support. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_extract_linear.c:
	(12:40:55) Fixed memory leaks. 

2008-02-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(17:02:42) Don't bother performing ZTR_FORM_TSHIFT transformation
	on the solexa noise data as it doesn't help it at all. Also hard
	coded the interlaced huffman to operate in batches of 2 instead of
	8 for noise data for the same reason. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/ztr_translate.c:
	(17:07:15) ztr2read() now correctly handles translation of ZTR
	files with multiple samples in. Specifically it only sets the Read
	struct baseline and trace[ACGT] arrays when the TYPE meta-data
	field is blank, PROC or A,C,G T.
	
	This fixes trace_dump etc on solexa srf files, (note that the srf
	files themselves were perfect valid anyway). 

2008-02-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.h:
	(17:16:41) Improved the memory allocate for affine_align. It now
	dynamically shrinks the band to try and keep within it's memory
	settings. I'm not 100% sure this works in all cases, but it seems
	sound and works in the tests I've done. 

	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c:
	(17:20:43) Modified align_blocks() to no longer aggressively filter
	overlapping blocks overlap < MAX_BLOCK_OVERLAP. This value is both
	arbitrary and not necessary. Fundamentallty it's the wrong thing to
	do. If we limit this anywhere it should be in the computed
	diag_shift (consider the case of 1kb of TA repeat shifted by 20
	bases, giving 980k overlap by 20 base diag).
	
	Also modified the band size computation upper limit. It was capped
	at 5kb before, but now it's a variable size based on knowledge of
	how much memory will be used up. This is cunningly designed in
	order to not trigger the excessive memory code checks in
	align_lib.c 

2008-02-06  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c:
	(11:04:38) Use set_compression_method to explicitly disable gzipped
	output from extract_seq (which is by default on if the input is
	gzipped). 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/Attic/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_qual.c:
	(11:04:59) Added Steven Leonard's extract_qual program (derived
	from extract_seq). 

2008-01-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(09:47:42) Sped up parse_4_int and parse_4_float substantially. 

2008-01-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:38:34) Fixed small memory leak in zfopen/zfclose.
	
	Fixed a bug where reorder_ztr could put CNF4 before BASE, breaking
	the decoding.
	
	Added support for loading solexa matrix and params files into
	appropriately named TEXT key/value pairs. It also adds the
	PROGRAM_ID there now too.
	
	Sped up chastity filtering. We now only read the line of text
	rather than decode it for data that is filtered.
	
	Minor tweaks to program usage output. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/trace_dump.c:
	(11:39:09) Updated output to be more inline with srf_dump_all. Also
	now supports baseline properly. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(11:39:34) Added ZTR_FORM_XRLE2, ZTR_FORM_QSHIFT and
	ZTR_FORM_TSHIFT. 

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES,
	* src/io_lib/ChangeLog,
	* src/io_lib/README,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(12:02:03) Bumped release to 1.11.0b8 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(12:23:38) Fixed whinges from icc regarding signed vs unsigned char
	*. 

2008-01-24  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/ztr.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/ztr.h:
	(17:17:52) Two new utility functions that are *long* overdue.
	
	ztr_new_chunk() - creates and initialises a new chunk in a ztr
	struct.
	
	ztr_add_text() - adds arbitrary key/value pairs to the TEXT chunk, 
		     creating it if required. 

2008-01-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h:
	(11:07:40) Allow for srf_read_index_hdr() to be used to read an
	index internal to the file rather than at the end of the file. To
	accommodate this an extra "no_seek" argument has been added. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(11:10:56) Support multiple trace channels (raw "int" & noise, in
	addition to or instead of the processed data).
	
	Input data may now optionally be compressed.
	
	Added a -c option to do chastity filtering via the .qhg files.
	
	Improved the dynamic range filtering. We no longer trim all
	negative values in preference for high positive values. Instead we
	set the clip points to trim the least number of total values. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(11:11:35) Fixed the baseline subtraction. It now uses the correct
	value instead of a hardcoded 32768. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_extract_linear.c:
	(11:12:15) Changed to use the new srf_read_index_hdr arguments. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_index_hash.c:
	(11:13:12) Improved index support when the input is concatenated
	SRF files already containing indices. It now overwrites the last
	index. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(11:13:47) Added display of meta-data TYPE field for trace sample
	chunks. 

2008-01-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_index_hash.c:
	(16:57:36) Bug fixes to do with reading and writing the index
	format. We incorrectly handled having null dbhFile and
	containerFile elements, plus also computed the index size wrong for
	these fields too. 

2008-01-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:
	(11:35:09) IMPORTANT BUG FIX: The SRF Data Block Header had the
	blockSize field 4 bytes too large, so SRF files produced did not
	conform to the standard.
	
	Also fixed SRF reading support for when headerBlob is zero length.
	We then delay ztr decoding until we've read the actual data blob. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/compression.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/deflate_interlaced.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/deflate_interlaced.h,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/ztr.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/ztr_translate.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(12:26:11) Added missing prototypes and fixed various signed vs
	unsigned assignments, as spotted by the Intel C Compiler. 

	* src/io_lib/ChangeLog,
	* src/io_lib/README,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(12:44:15) Minor tweaks - preparations for v1.11.0b7 

2008-01-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c:

2007-12-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/io_lib/srf.h,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_index_hash.c:
	(18:50:46) Updates to SRF 1.3. This includes removal of the readID
	counter and added support for printf style formatting. It also has
	some tweaks to the format for the index (32-bit vs 64-bit and
	dbh/container file strings).
	
	Both versions have therefore been bumped (SRF 1.3 and index 1.01).
	
	TODO: support for extracting data from an SRF file that's split
	with container headers, trace headers and trace bodies all in
	separate files.

	* src/spin/spin,
	* src/spin_emboss/create_emboss_files,
	* src/trev/trev:
	(14:31:01) Changed how the STADENROOT is identified and applied.
	The startup scripts now ignore the STADENROOT_1_7 environment
	variable and always rerun the staden login scripts. Not so
	efficient, but less prone to problems.
	
	If the STADEN_PREPEND environment variable is defined (and
	non-blank) then we prepend path, manpath, ld_library_path. This is
	used in the wrapper scripts to ensure we override any previous
	staden.profile script. 

2007-11-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(13:57:30) Improved handling of out-of-range data. Specifically
	what happens when the minimum value in a trace is -40000 and the
	maximum value is +50000. We now clip -ve values if the range
	doesn't fit. 

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c:
	(17:22:13) The affine_align function now correctly estimates memory
	using a double instead of int (to avoid wraparound). When the
	memory is too large it bails out too.
	
	The FIJ function now uses this as an indicator to fall back to
	using the fast alignment method if the slow method has spotted
	it'll take up too much memory/cpu. 

2007-11-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(14:26:35) Improved support for ztr OFFS metadata and removed the
	old crufty SHIFT_BY #define. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(17:35:58) Bug fix: we were missing the trailing nul of the trace
	OFFS metadata value.
	
	Also the setting of min_val when the range is too high was invalid.
	Note further work is needed here as we've already truncated to
	16-bit making it impossible to tell where the wraparound occurs. 

2007-10-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2fastq.c:
	(10:35:56) Added srf2fastq conversion to demonstrate usage of
	read_sections() and as a benchmark for pure sequence+quality
	extraction. (It appears to cope at about 100,000 sequences/second.) 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf2solexa.c:
	(11:35:59) Switched to using srf_next_ztr() in order to avoid
	repeated huffman codeset decoding. Now much faster.

	(14:28:27) *** empty log message ***

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_extract_linear.c:
	(14:21:16) Upgraded SRF to support v1.2 specification. NOTE: No
	support is kept for v1.1!
	
	Dramatically improved the speed of sequential decoding (eg in
	srf_dump_all) by use of caching huffman_codeset_t structs. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/srf_dump_all.c:
	(16:55:24) Added unused (#if-ed out) printf variant. It's for
	possible efficiency gains, but ignoring for now. 

2007-10-17  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:56:11) Dropped ZLIB compression of BPOS as A) it's tiny anyway
	and B) we don't want to waste time compressing it over and over
	again. (TODO: actually we don't need to encode it over and over
	again either.) 

2007-10-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(08:36:05) Improvements to speed following code profiling. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/solexa2srf.c:
	(16:49:38) Major overhaul of parsing code. We now roll our own
	specialist parser instead of using strtok and sscanf. This has
	approximately doubled the speed (so maybe 4-5x faster in the
	parsing component). 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(16:52:06) Boost version to 1.11.0b3

	(11:07:15) File Edit Options Buffers Tools Help Version 1.11.0b1
	
	Added preliminary SRF support. This consists of a new subdirectory
	'srf' (yes these all really need merging into a single directory,
	but that's a later task), a substantial update to ZTR and a variety
	of SRF tools in progs.
	
	The old huffman_static.[ch] files were renamed and substantially
	worked upon to create deflate_interlaced.[ch].
	
	Added new compression types. xrle2, tshift and qshift. The latter
	two of these are very specific to trace and quality packings. May
	need to rename to be more generic.

	commit). This should resolve some of the NFS delays. 

2007-09-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/ztr/deflate_simple.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/deflate_simple.h:
	(11:11:12) Mostly a rename from huffman_static to deflate_simple,
	but also a large overhaul and redesign. This code implements the
	huffman component of the Deflate algorithm. 

	* src/io_lib/ztr/compression.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/compression.h,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.h:

	deflate_simple. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(11:34:09) Updates for renaming of huffman_static to
	deflate_simple. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am,

	(11:34:10) Updates for renaming of huffman_static to

	* src/io_lib/ztr/compression.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/huffman_static.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/huffman_static.h:
	(15:30:04) Major overhaul of huffman_static.c.
	
	It's been substantially tuned for speed and also has several bug
	fixes to ensure we have a consistent sort function before applying
	the canonical_codes function (which previously meant differing
	qsort implementations would give different codes). 

	* src/io_lib/ztr/FORMAT-1.2:
	(15:31:58) Created a snapshot of FORMAT for ZTR v1.2 only 

2007-08-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* staden.login,
	* staden.profile:
	(09:29:46) We now append instead of prepend to paths. This may
	cause problems in some cases, but it is better behaved when part of
	a mixed environment of several packages as it gives control back to
	the user for the order in which they want package paths defined.
	
	Also removed TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY definitions (was not
	present in csh version anyway) and added them to the various
	wrapper scripts. This makes the package better behaved on systems
	using tcl/tk for other purposes. 

	* src/copy_reads/copy_reads,

	* src/spin/spin,
	* src/spin_emboss/create_emboss_files,
	* src/trev/trev:
	(09:32:50) Added explicit TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY definitions.
	These were in the staden.profile, but for the sake of not trampling
	over other applications by changing the global environment I made
	these local to the wrapper scripts. 

	* src/tk_utils/stash.c:
	(13:50:06) Ensure environment is sane. Specifically if TCL_LIBRARY
	and TK_LIBRARY haven't been defined then we default them to
	$STADLIB/tcl and $STADLIB/tk 

2007-08-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/spin_emboss/create_emboss_files.tcl,
	* src/spin_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl:
	(10:28:53) Changed usage of embossdata so it works with 4.0
	onwards. 

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(16:40:42) Reverted accidental change in the scoring of Ns when
	using the frequency consensus mode. This was changed in 1.9 from
	scoring 5 to scoring 0 (for some forgotten reason) and the change
	was erroneously incorporated when adding the FLT_EPSILON fixes. 

2007-08-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(10:26:05) Fixed sign of FLT_EPSILON (+ to -) for some checks. This
	basically adjusts on which side of a comparison we want to adjust
	for error.
	
	The change means that the old style consensus algorithm no longer
	calls Ns on opterons when consensus cutoff is 100%. This also fixes
	the "remove pad columns" function. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	(16:51:00) Added a guard against fin->io so "finish .f; .f version"
	works. 

2007-08-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(11:09:01) Protected against rounding errors so that checking
	quality 1.9999999998 against a cutoff of 2 no longer fails. All
	checks against cons_cutoff take heed of FLT_EPSILON. 

2007-07-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/acinclude.m4,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(08:03:42) Updated configure.in to support --with-lib=DIR. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/files.c:
	(08:05:23) Switched from using tempnam() to tmpfile(). This meant
	recreating tmpfile() wrapper on MS Windows to avoid bugs with it
	always attempting to write to the root directory, regardless of
	user privs. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/os.h:
	(08:05:24) Switched from using tempnam() to tmpfile(). This meant
	recreating tmpfile() wrapper on MS Windows to avoid bugs with it
	always attempting to write to the root directory, regardless of
	user privs. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_extract.c:
	(09:01:39) Fixed bug on windows: we now set stdout to be binary
	mode first. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(09:02:51) INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: On windows we now use semi-colon as
	the path separator. The reason is that with the MinGW getenv()
	seems to do "clever things" with PATH variables and consequently
	ends up corrupting our clumsy attempt of escaping colons in paths. 

2007-07-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/jenkins_lookup3.h:
	(13:57:26) Added Bob Jenkins' lookup3.c code to the hash_table
	support. It also now uses this for 64-bit hashing. 

2007-07-06  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	first sequence. 

	* src/io_lib/ztr/FORMAT,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/huffman_static.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/huffman_static.h,

	STHUFF (static huffman) compression methods. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(08:29:15) Updated to support the new static-huffman compression
	method. 

	* src/io_lib/ztr/huffman_static.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/huffman_static.h:
	(10:45:48) Removed potentially variable huffman trees (solexa
	trace, confidence values) and added an english text tree. This was
	based on War of the Worlds, The Gold Bug, 200000 Leagues Under the
	Sea and the "man ascii" unix manual page for a bit of variety. It
	also includes the SYM_ANY escape code for handling out-of-band
	data. 

2007-06-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/config.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/xtoplevel.tcl:

	* src/seq_utils/filter_words.c,
	* src/seq_utils/filter_words.h:
	(14:38:21) Oops, forgot to check this in! Needed for auto_break.c
	in Gap4 and shared by the prefinish library. 

2007-01-31  awhitwham  <awhitwham@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/seq_utils/Makefile:
	(14:51:17) Added filter_words 

2006-10-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/auto_break.c,
	* src/gap4/auto_break.h:
	(13:18:34) New file to implement an experimental automatic assembly
	breaker function.
	
	Specifically it looks for common "words" (in either sequences or
	consensus) to identify repetitive sequence. It then uses these to
	clip the ends of sequences to identify whether contigs are held
	together entirely by sequence overlaps of repetitive elements. When
	found it then verifies this "gap" by checking for valid vs invalid
	read-pairs. 

	* src/gap4/Makefile,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(13:20:41) Interface for the new auto_break function. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(13:22:06) Minor tidyup for c89 compliance instead of accidentally
	using c9x features. 

	* src/gap4/readpair.c:
	(13:23:35) Added experimental compilation option to show internal
	read-pairs when plotting in the contig selector. 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(13:25:17) Allow for templates to be too small and still be valid
	(controlled at compilation time via #define). Rationale is that the
	small fragments have already migrated through the band we cut out
	on the gel and so there may be some residual left (stuck for some
	reason). This is bourn out by the fact that our distribution is
	rarely perfectly symmetrical. 

	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(13:25:42) Added missing prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(13:26:11) Increased the dynamic range for the Y scalebar. 

2006-09-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/seqInfo.c:
	(12:40:54) Bug fixed the fasta header editing; it now correctly
	trims newline, tabs and spaces. 

2006-08-31  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* staden.profile:
	(09:03:01) Updated STADENROOT_1_6 to STADENROOT_1_7. Also only set

	(11:23:25) Fixed buffer underrun in edNextDifference. 

2006-08-07  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(14:12:39) Added -signed and -noneg options to perform shifting of
	trace data to avoid the unsigned issues for TRACE. 

2006-07-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(13:42:41) Default to anytr format instead of any. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/traceType.c:
	(13:44:13) Added support for anytr in str2int and int2str
	conversions.

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(13:43:28) Added mfcreate_from(). It has a usage syntax identical
	to mfreopen(), but unlike mfreopen() it doesn't do anything with
	the file pointer (neither closing ie or remembering it in the
	structure). 

	* doc/manual/extract_fastq.1.texi,

	(16:18:33) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_fastq.c:

	(16:20:17) Added -ztr as a command line option. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_exp.c:
	(16:21:14) Hash_exp now outputs to the same file containing the
	experiment files (in appended hash-table mode).

	(16:21:53) Bug fix: now only needs at least 1 filename specified
	when fofn mode is not in use. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_list.c:
	(16:22:40) error detection and protection 

2006-06-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* doc/ReleaseNotes:
	(09:20:34) Preparation for 1.7.0 

	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.c:
	(09:22:23) reg_get_arg() now returns "" instead of NULL in error
	case, which means all the code which never bothers to check the
	return code now gracefully brushes past any problems. (Not ideal I
	know...) 

	* src/spin/sip_sendto.tcl:
	(09:23:20) Updated to work with Spin calls instead of Sip calls.
	It's not being used, but in testing with Gap4 (temporarily
	reenabled) it's now working again. 

	* src/spin2_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl,
	* src/spin_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl:
	(09:24:14) Newer embossdata expect something on stdin, so we give
	it some. This fixes a hang when starting spin. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(09:24:48) Nip/Sip -> Spin (A change in commented out code only.) 

	* src/windows/wix/banner.bmp:
	* src/windows/wix/new.bmp,
	* src/windows/wix/splash.bmp:
	(10:53:37) Marked as binary 

2006-06-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(12:14:58) Fixed a bug when aligning sequences containing "."
	characters. 

	* mklinks:
	(15:51:59) Added lib/haplo 

2006-06-28  awhitwham  <awhitwham>

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(08:18:10) Added opteron and itanium support 

	* mklinks:
	(08:46:01) Added new binary links and fixed gap4 link name 

2006-06-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(11:16:21) Bug fix to the previous change: mstdin(), mstdout() and
	mstderr() now correctly mark their streams and read and write
	capable. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(15:48:15) Added mfdetach() to allow the file pointer to be closed
	without deallocating the mFILE structure.
	
	Also removed the mFILE->fname component and replaced uses with
	checks to mode & MF_WRITE. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(15:58:52) Corrected duff spelling! 

2006-06-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(16:47:30) Fixed a bug in mfflush whereby it could attempt to write
	HUGE amounts of data (-ve size) when files are truncated before
	flushing; it now fseeks before doing the write and checks if the
	size is +ve.
	
	Also fixed mfwrite to correctly reset the flush_pos record.
	
	Added a mode field to the mFILE structure so we can keep track of
	append and read-only flags. These are checked for in the mfwrite
	function so mfwrite now writes to the correct location when append
	mode is used (ie forced to the end of file) and it now returns 0
	when attempting to write to a read-only mFILE. 

2006-06-20  awhitwham  <awhitwham>

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:

	(15:42:06) Added a ZTR_FORM_LOG2 compression technique. It's an
	experimental lossy compression and is turned off right now; the
	space saving was only about 10% and if we go lossy I want big
	changes not small ones. 

	* src/io_lib/README:
	(15:43:46) *** empty log message *** 

2006-06-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(08:53:43) Added a -error option to request stderr goes to a file
	instead of stderr. (from Saul Kravitz) 

	* src/io_lib/scf/misc_scf.c,
	* src/io_lib/scf/read_scf.c,
	* src/io_lib/scf/write_scf.c:
	(08:58:12) Renamed delta_samples[12] to be scf_delta_samples[12].
	(patch supplied by Saul Kravitz) 

	* src/io_lib/scf/scf.h:
	(08:58:29) Renamed delta_samples[12] to be scf_delta_samples[12].
	(patch supplied by Saul Kravitz) 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(08:58:55) Comment update 

	* src/mk/linux-x86_64.mk:
	(10:57:07) Config for AMD Opterons 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:28:28) Renamed USE_LIBCURL to be HAVE_LIBCURL to make it
	compatible with autoconf. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(16:28:29) Renamed USE_LIBCURL to be HAVE_LIBCURL to make it
	compatible with autoconf. 

	* src/io_lib/bootstrap:
	(16:28:56) Added removal of io_lib-config 

	* src/io_lib/acinclude.m4,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(16:29:55) Added libcurl checking code (in acinclude.m4). 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib-config.in:
	(16:31:18) New io_lib-config program to query the compile and link
	parameters needed when using io_lib. 

	* src/io_lib/io_lib.m4:
	(16:46:32) Initial draft (unchecked) of autoconf macros for use by
	packages (in configure.in) that want to make use of io_lib. 

2006-06-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* staden.login,
	* staden.profile:
	(11:44:50) Added linux-x86_64 MACHINE definition. 

	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c,
	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(11:50:17) Made the hashing code automatically realloc some of its
	memory structures. This cures a problem where with some highly
	repetitive elements the join editor would fail in the fast
	"compare_b" hashed alignment method as the number of word hits >
	length of sequence.
	
	Also upped the maximum length of the fallback dynamic alignment
	strategy from 2Kb to 10Kb. It'll be slow and memory hungry at 10Kb,
	but with modern CPUs it's not not so bad.
	
	Finally fixed a bug in the alignment printing code; it now clips
	the right hand overhang correctly. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile:
	(11:50:47) Added ZLIB_INC include path. 

	* tables/shlib.conf:
	(12:42:30) Added linux-x86_64 definition 

2006-06-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(08:53:24) Somewhere along the line I managed to break the most
	common of all search mechanisms; local filenames on disk! Fixed
	find_file_dir(). 

2006-06-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Misc/os.h:
	(13:10:56) Added back uint1 definition. Not sure why it was
	removed. 

	* src/gap4/reading_coverage.c:
	(13:12:08) No effect; Added some "#if 0"ed out code for doing hacky
	log plots of the reading depth as it was useful for debugging
	something. 

	* src/gap4/seqInfo.c:
	(13:14:55) Overhaul of exp_read_staden_info function, including
	changing the prototype. It no longer users fopen and takes an mFILE
	instead (meaning it will work via io_lib and remote file accesses). 

	* src/gap4/seqInfo.h:
	(13:15:25) New prototype for read_sequence_details(). 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(13:15:58) Use mkdir "-p" option when creating new directories so
	../lib/alpha-binaries for example will create ../lib too. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(13:21:59) Added libcurl support and made this the default instead
	of using WGET for URL based accesses. Fixed a bug in the old wget
	code also though involving handling of zero-sized replies.
	
	Removed the compressed file extension iteration code in
	find_file_dir as it's now included in the master open_trace_file
	function instead (and so was yielding stats on fubar.scf.gz.bz2 and
	similar). It's also now possible to turn off the compressed file
	extension iteration code by prefixing a search path element with a
	"|" symbol.
	
	Replaced RAWDATA environment with EXP_PATH and TRACE_PATH. These
	default back to RAWDATA when not defined. Created new functions
	named open_exp_file and open_exp_mfile which use EXP_PATH instead
	of TRACE_PATH. These allow for experiment files and trace files to
	share the same names (as is the case in external "trace servers")
	but use different accessor routes to return the data. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.h:
	(13:22:40) New prototypes or the open_exp_{file,mfile} code and
	iolib_[sg]et_{trace,exp}_path calls. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_exp.c:
	(13:25:15) New program hash_exp. This allows for multiple
	experiment files to be concatenated together instead a single
	multi-sequence file and then be indexed (using hash_exp) to allow
	for a HASH=... EXP_PATH element to extract the data back out again. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c,
	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c,
	* src/io_lib/read/Read.h,
	* src/io_lib/read/scf_extras.c,
	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(13:28:29) Make use of open_exp_mfile instead of open_trace_mfile
	when we know we've explicitly requested a file in EXP format. This
	ensures we'll use the correct search path where appropriate.
	
	Also defined an ANYTR trace format which is identical to the old
	ANY format except that it excludes EXP and PLN (ie "ANY TRace").
	Again this is used internally to ensure we pick the correct search
	path when dealing with fetching traces and/or experiment files. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(13:29:23) Fixed a bug in mfseek and mrewind. Both now clear the
	EOF flag. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/traceType.c:
	(13:33:16) Bug fix to fdetermine_trace_type: now rewinds back. 

	* src/pregap4/modules/cross_match_svec.p4m:
	(13:34:29) Improved detection of vector running to the end; it now
	checks if it is close to the quality clip point rather than the
	absolute sequence end point. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c:
	(13:35:17) Added extra array bounds checking in the determine
	extents code. 

	* mklinks:
	(14:01:25) It now creates the $MACHINE-bin directories 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(15:21:02) Fixed the include/.links target (added sff) 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_fastq.c:
	(15:22:24) Added extract_fastq program. 

2006-05-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/ztr/compression.c:
	(08:46:57) Fixed a bug in xrle(); it now correctly handles runs of
	256 or more. 

2006-04-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(10:51:56) Fixed find_oligo (aka Sequence Search) when given blank
	filenames. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(10:53:27) Changed various fwrite_* functions to not close the FILE
	pointer given to them. 

	* src/prefinish/Makefile:
	(10:53:49) Make install updates 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.h,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(10:56:53) Added a "stick" style so that Solexa data can be viewed.
	This also shows 4 confidence values in log-odds format (+ve and -ve
	values).
	
	Maybe also fixed a display glitch in drawing traces too. The
	visible extents of the region to redraw is now computed in its own
	function and hopefully therefore called in all cases rather than
	just some. 

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(10:57:19) Added -style stick as an option. 

2006-02-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/ztr/compression.c:
	(17:10:36) Fixed bug reading past memory in xrle(). (Thanks to
	Kathryn Beal for identifying this.) 

2006-02-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.h:
	(14:40:06) Removed static from compress_chunk and uncompress_chunk.
	Added prototypes to ztr.h. 

2006-02-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/read_alloc.c:
	(15:08:36) Fixed a bug in read_dup and not initialising read->info. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/read_alloc.c:
	(16:00:44) Fixed typo. 

2006-02-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(11:27:20) Minor fix to implement_solutions so that when finding
	solutions but all solutions fail the experiment scores then it now
	jumps on one reading length instead of to the end of the problem
	region. 

2006-02-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c:
	(12:16:50) Allow HashTableAdd to take a non-string for the key. 

2006-01-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	(09:37:02) Fixed HashTableAdd with non-string keys and without
	HASH_NONVOLATILE_KEYS defined. It used strdup, but now allocates
	and memcpys.
	
	Added HashTableDel and HashTableRemove functions. HashTableDel
	removes and destroys a specified HashItem. HashTableRemove removes
	and destroys all items attached to a given key. 

2006-01-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.tcl:
	(14:31:54) Shut down open displays before editing. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(14:32:51) Added check for validity of alignment (to avoid
	crashes). Check for gaps in contigs and break contig when suitable. 

	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c:
	(14:33:34) Fixed memory corruption (double free) when dealing with
	alignments that fail. 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.h,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(17:07:57) Added an option to search for matches from a file (FASTA
	format preferably). 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(17:07:58) Added an option to search for matches from a file (FASTA
	format preferably). 

	* src/seq_utils/sequence_formats.c:
	(17:09:35) Fixed write_sequence (used in reading, not writing!) to
	nul terminate strings.
	
	Fixed get_fasta_format_seq to allow the identifier to be passed as
	NULL (as it is when called via get_seq instead of get_seq_ft). 

2005-12-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES,
	* src/io_lib/README,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(14:35:00) Update for 1.9.2 

2005-12-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* staden.login,
	* staden.profile:
	(12:04:18) Added MACHINE definition to treat x86_64 as a standard
	x86 linux. Also updated the version string correctly
	(STADENROOT_1_6). 

	* src/gap4/gap4:
	(12:06:06) Rewrote the stash wrapper scripts to source
	staden.profile if needed so that we only have one place to modify
	variables (eg the recent MACHINE change). 

	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger,
	* src/prefinish/prefinish,
	* src/pregap4/pregap4,
	* src/spin/spin,
	* src/spin_emboss/create_emboss_files,
	* src/trev/trev:
	(12:06:07) Rewrote the stash wrapper scripts to source
	staden.profile if needed so that we only have one place to modify
	variables (eg the recent MACHINE change). 

2005-12-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c,
	* src/gap4/join.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(17:03:57) Added align left and align right buttons in the join
	editor ("<" and ">"). These anchor one end of the alignment at the
	editing cursor and align from that point either leftwards or
	rightwards (with the other end being able to move about). The old
	align button still works as normal.
	
	To achieve this the align_wrap function was also modified to honour
	the edge_mode parameter when doing a block based method. The align
	button now sets edge_mode accordingly to flag which ends need to be
	penalise pads. 

	* src/gap4/cs-object.h,
	* src/gap4/do_fij.c,
	* src/gap4/fij.c:
	(17:06:44) Find internal joins results now also track the alignment
	score in addition to the percentage identity. Alignment score is
	now the score for sorting the matches in order. 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(17:07:23) Fixed so that matches in lower case sequences are found
	(sure I'd already fixed it, but I guess not). 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(17:09:33) Fixed tk-error bug when searching by consensus
	difference (join editor mode). 

	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c:
	(17:10:39) overlap->score is now computed in seq_to_overlap such
	that a mismatch or gap scores -4 and a match scores +1. 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(17:32:31) Added AC_CHECK_LIB calls for nsl and socket
	(gethostbyname and socket). Needed for Solaris compilations. 

2005-12-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* doc/manual/contig_navigation-t.texi:
	(12:38:27) Added info on file format. 

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(12:40:00) Fixed a parsing bug for the input file. Now uses the
	proper methods to quit an editor so that you are asked to save
	changes if edits were made. Added Page Up and Page Down buttons for
	prev/next item. 

	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(12:40:40) Added a show_problem_traces method to hook in with the
	editor Auto-display Traces setting. Used by the new contig
	navigator functionality. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(12:41:00) Added defs for Contig Navigator. 

	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl:
	(15:18:21) Added a Save button to the list viewer/editor. 

2005-11-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(12:48:26) Protect against non ACGT*- characters being in
	sequences. 

2005-11-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/haplo/haplo.h,
	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(16:25:41) Added an option to force a maximum number of groups,
	even if it means arbitrarily merging. 

2005-11-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(14:12:58) Removed dead shuffle pads code, but reenabled the
	removal of columns of pads in the contig editor by changing the old
	editor shuffle_pads command to be strip_pads. 

	* src/gap4/edCommands.c,
	* src/gap4/edCommands.h,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(14:12:59) Removed dead shuffle pads code, but reenabled the
	removal of columns of pads in the contig editor by changing the old
	editor shuffle_pads command to be strip_pads. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(14:13:34) Fixed crash when the number of snps found was zero. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c:
	(14:14:16) Used open_trace_mfile instead of open_trace_file to
	avoid the need for temporary files and hence speeds this up. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(14:23:23) fwrite_reading now frees the temporary mFILE it created. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.h,
	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(14:45:41) Added private_data and private_size to the Read
	structure & populate from SCF. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(14:48:51) mfreopen_compressed no longer closes the original FILE*.
	This makes it backwards compatible once more with the original
	version and also cures a bug whereby the old file pointer was often
	left open, leading to running out of file descriptors. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(15:05:51) Fixed uninitialised check when filename was specified
	but not found in mfload. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/read_alloc.c:
	(15:17:01) Added private_data to read struct 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(15:19:39) Added strip pads (aka pad column removal) defaults 

	* ChangeLog,
	* NEWS:
	(16:42:08) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(17:09:10) Allow for the consensus to include IUBC codes (incase
	it's been enabled). 

2005-11-10  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_extract.c:
	(11:32:06) Now returns an error code (to the calling process) if it
	failed to extract a sequence. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c:
	(11:33:07) Fixed problem in hashquery when searching for something
	that has a hash key not present (ie empty hash bucket). 

2005-10-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(15:46:45) Fixed hang in mfload when given zero length files. 

2005-10-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h,
	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c,
	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.h,
	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.tcl:
	(08:19:41) Made the band size a configurable parameter.
	
	Also fixed a bug with tag corruptions on both complemented readings
	and on the consensus. 

	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(08:20:26) NDEBUG checks 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(08:20:56) Added band size parameter for shuffle pads. Removed old
	contig editor shuffle pads settings. 

2005-10-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/bootstrap:
	(09:15:23) Removed more auto-generated files. 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am:
	(09:16:43) Further removal of libtool specific bits (AC_CHECK_LIB). 

	* src/haplo/haplo_snps.c:
	(16:02:59) Improved how the SNP base calls are computed for each
	template. We now compute a simple consensus for the template rather
	than just throwing out that SNP position on a template if there are
	mismatches within the template. The template consensus has to be
	above the minimum quality threshold to be accepted. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(16:03:35) Fixed bug with IOLIB_ZTR vs IOLIB_SFF macro. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/bootstrap,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in,
	* src/io_lib/read/Read.h,
	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(16:04:48) Replaced automake's generated config.h file
	io_lib_config and allow for it to be installed with "make install". 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am:
	(16:05:19) Added append_sff to the targets. 

	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(16:05:42) Disabled asserts 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(16:06:25) Fixed bug in mfgetc when dealing with 8-bit data. It
	always now returns unsigned values except when EOF 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:07:20) Updated TAR magic number to be just the 5 first bytes as
	the 6th differs between systems (space vs nul). 

2005-10-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/notes.c,
	* src/gap4/notes.h:
	(13:27:37) Added a find_note function to check if a specific note
	type is attached to a given reading. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_snps.c:
	(13:29:10) Now skips reference sequences (note "REFS") from SNP
	detection. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.h,
	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(13:30:30) Made the arbitrary "0.6" figure in the calc_edge_score
	function a configurable parameter (-correlation_offset), all the
	way back to the GUI. The default is now 0.9 too which works much
	better when >2 haplotypes are present. 

	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.c:
	(13:31:22) Split the read functions into read & decode functions so
	that we can unpack SFF structs from other sources. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/append_sff.c:
	(13:31:58) Added an append_sff.c program, to combine multiple SFF
	archives into a single archive. 

2005-10-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(16:41:44) Modified to check RAWDATA search path when loading
	traces. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_sff.c:
	(16:42:58) Major overhaul to not load the entire SFF file into
	memory. It also handles copying the SFF file to a new file and
	adding an index to an SFF archive that already has an index. 

	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.c,
	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.h:
	(16:44:31) Restructured read functions to load & decode functions
	so we can decode SFF data blocks obtained via other means (eg as
	used in the indexing code). 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:45:42) Added SFF "sorted index" code, based on 454's getsff.c
	implementation. Also restructured the SFF querying code a bit so
	that it caches this data. 

2005-10-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES:
	(16:07:36) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(16:08:32) Renamed _MSV_VER to _WIN32 so that the binary/ascii
	conversions for experiment file IO works once more under Windows. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_sff.c:
	(16:09:08) Added hash_sff program. This adds a .hsh format index to
	the SFF container. 

	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.c,
	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.h:
	(16:10:10) A total rewrite of the SFF code due to the recent
	changes in file format. This code handles access of a *single* SFF
	entry. The code to manipulate multi-file SFF (ie the container) is
	in open_trace_file.c. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	(16:11:33) HashFileSave now returns the length of the saved hash.
	
	HashFileFopen now sets afp by default to be the same as hfp. Extra
	checking has been added when closing these file pointers to ensure
	we don't close twice if they point to the same FILE*. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(16:12:58) Added an mfascii() function. This allows for changing
	from binary to ascii after a file has been opened. It should be
	called in place of where the windows-specific _set_mode() function
	would be used.
	
	There is currently no analagous ascii-to-binary conversion, but I
	have not yet found a need for it either. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mach-io.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mach-io.h:
	(16:13:29) Added [bl]e_{read,write}_int_8 functions for use with
	8-byte data types found in SFF. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:14:55) Added a SFF= format for the RAWDATA search path. This
	handles the SFF container in much the same way that TAR= and HASH=
	works.
	
	Also for all three of these types you can now do archive/entry
	instead. Eg "extract_seq traces.tar/xyz.ztr" will work and it'll
	even look for traces.tar in RAWDATA if required. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/os.h:
	(16:15:19) Added a uint1 typedef for completeness. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/read/Makefile.am:
	(16:16:06) Makefile support for new sff.c files. 

	* src/io_lib/dependencies:
	(16:16:23) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(16:16:43) Updated to version 1.9.1.

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(08:54:07) Changed .so for .dylib under Darwin 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(08:54:30) Added sff to make distsrc 

	* src/mk/alpha.mk:

	* src/spin/tkSeqed.c,
	* src/tk_utils/matrix.c:
	(09:01:05) removed duplicated function names. bell() is same code.
	print_matrix() was different, but debugging.
	
	Reason is to prevent compilation issues under macosx 

	* src/windows/wix/README:
	(09:08:24) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c:
	(11:34:03) Cast ptrdiff_t value to int for %.*s argument. 

	* src/make_weights/make_weights.c:
	(11:34:31) Fixed = vs == bug so that char_set was always treated as
	DNA. 

	* src/primer3/src/primer3_lib.c:
	(11:35:04) Tidied up prototype of find_stop_codon to prevent icc
	warnings. 

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(15:59:25) Use 'orig_format' instead of 'format' method for saving
	a trace when exiting trev or using next/prev. This fixes a bug
	where interactive clipping (among other places) would create ztr
	files after clipping.

	* lib/itcl3.3/pkgIndex.tcl:
	(10:57:51) Auto-detect windows vs unix dll name. 

	* lib/itk3.3/pkgIndex.tcl:
	(10:58:02) Auto-detect windows vs unix dll name. 

	* src/windows/wix/staden.wxs:

	* demo/gap4/DEMO.0,
	* demo/gap4/DEMO.0.aux,
	* demo/gap4/traces.tar,
	* demo/gap4/Attic/traces.tar.hash:
	(13:24:44) Appended the traces.tar.hash to traces.tar (using the
	new hash format) and updated the search path in the gapdb
	accordingly. 

	* Makefile:
	(13:34:29) Added use of lib subdir for distwindows

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	(16:04:06) Fixed the hash file saving and loading so that it works
	on all platforms instead of just x86 linux. There were bugs in
	assuming the size of structures. The assumptions are still there in
	that I assume they pad the same internally (for ease of coding - we
	can change it when we finally see a system which operates
	differently), but the final "boundary" padding has been resolved. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(16:20:45) Removed load of /tmp/nuc_matrix. The default one in
	tables will have already been loaded and is sufficient (I hope...
	the one in /tmp long bit the dust!) 

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl:
	(16:49:32) Added help link 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl,

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(10:43:49) Fixed a bug in Report Mutations causing potential
	crashes and/or a lack of images in the HTML report. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edMutations.c,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h:
	(10:44:41) Added a minimum quality slider to the Report Mutations
	"by differences" mode. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(10:45:25) Added a minimum quality slider to the Report Mutations
	"by differences" mode. 

	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(10:47:30) Added a minimum quality slider to the Report Mutations
	"by differences" mode. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(10:48:21) Removed crash when inputting data that does not have
	trace points. Allows importing mixed trace + consensus/reference
	sequence files. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(10:49:09) Fixed trace_pyroalign(). 

2005-09-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c:
	(15:54:28) Fixed the computation of the re-padded coordinates for
	alignments made when the first sequence were complemented.
	Previously this could overstep an array bounding and hence gaves
	erratic positions. (Rarely seen, but easier to trigger using probe
	with single sequence.) 

2005-09-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(13:22:07) Changed the default trace type from " " to "ANY" for
	readings with no trace type record. 

2005-09-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(14:33:11) Fixed displaying and searching of edits when they happen
	to be the last base in a sequence. 

2005-09-19  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(13:58:02) Fixed a file descriptor (and some memory) leak in
	freopen_compressed. (Bug ID 1289095) 

2005-09-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(11:29:06) Don't try to compress SAMP chunks with meta-data PYRW as
	the raw pyrosequencing data from 454 doesn't compress. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_tar.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/Hash_File_Format,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	(11:30:56) Changed the HashFile format slightly. It's now format
	1.00.
	
	The key difference is that it has a file footer pointing back to
	the hashfile header (so the hashfile can be appended to an archive)
	and it also has an offset in the header to apply to all seeks
	within the archive itself, so it can be prepending to an archive
	that's already been indexed without breaking the offsets.
	
	Extended the hash_tar program to allow control over these header
	options.

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.h:
	(10:55:24) More fixes to shuffle pads. Removed memory leaks. Added
	code to keep tag positions up to date. Hopefully this now means all
	the known bugs and missing features have been dealt with. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.h:
	(10:55:57) Added header file for shuffle pads prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/edCommands.c:
	(14:30:18) Removed Shuffle Pads from the editor menus. However I
	also put back the old shuffle pads code (which worked better) so
	that the gaprc file can be edited to reenable it still if desired.
	It's been removed from the menu due to being superseded by the new
	re-alignment method. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_mito:
	(14:30:19) Removed Shuffle Pads from the editor menus. However I
	also put back the old shuffle pads code (which worked better) so
	that the gaprc file can be edited to reenable it still if desired.
	It's been removed from the menu due to being superseded by the new
	re-alignment method. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(14:31:09) Fixed search by sequence to reenable the 'where' clause
	(sequence or consensus). This was accidentally disabled. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(14:31:30) Removed debugging output. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:32:30) Added shuffle pads tcl/tk dialogue. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/README,
	* src/io_lib/options.mk:
	(15:15:24) Added draft SFF format support. I need to verify if the
	example data files I tested this with are correct or if the SFF
	draft spec is correct (as they differ marginally in places). Hence
	this format may change soon. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c,
	* src/io_lib/read/Read.h,
	* src/io_lib/utils/traceType.c:
	(15:15:25) Added draft SFF format support. I need to verify if the

	draft spec is correct (as they differ marginally in places). Hence
	this format may change soon. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(15:16:31) Added (commented out) code for extra debugging. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile:
	(15:16:48) Added hash_extract to the Makefile. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(15:17:43) Improved pyrosequencing style trace support by
	auto-scaling. 

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(15:18:17) Changed the default scale when displaying pyrosequencing
	traces. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(16:02:52) Fixed a bug where sequences originally ending in pads
	but not after realignment would cause a fatal error to be reported
	(wrongly) due to apparently having data missing after the
	alignment. 

2005-08-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edMutations.c:
	(09:28:54) Fixed crashes with using Report Mutations in HTML mode
	and finding mutations by base call differences rather than tags. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(13:38:03) Further work on shuffle pads. This latest code is
	substantially faster than before and also seems to work well except
	for currently not updating consensus annotations. 

	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.h:
	(13:38:30) Further work on shuffle pads. This latest code is
	substantially faster than before and also seems to work well except
	for currently not updating consensus annotations. 

2005-07-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(15:36:17) Fixed bug with not updating the in-memory
	io_relpos/io_length arrays. Removed debugging & general tidy up.
	Changed gap penalties from -8 to -9. 

2005-07-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/Makefile:
	(15:46:18) Added back the shuffle_pads code to the compilation. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(15:47:45) Reenabled the shuffle_pads command. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(15:49:41) Removed the old shuffle pads by align_sv code, but kept
	the interface to Rodger's malign code.
	
	Sped up the editing section by keeping the malign data up to date
	as we go instead of rebuilding after each pad. This has a massive
	speed improvement.
	
	Added code to write the new alignments back to the database. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(15:50:51) Fixed arg structure used (flukily worked before). 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(15:52:07) Unset compression_used when opening uncompressed files
	instead of leaving as the last value. 

	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c:
	(15:57:10) Added destroy_malign_counts, malign_insert_scores and
	malign_recalc_scores functions. The latter of these allow for
	updating of the malign scores and consensus elements after a
	contigl list has been updated. Used as a fast alternative to
	rebuilding from scratch.
	
	Removed unused msegs element of MALIGN struct.
	
	Allow for gap_open and gap_extend to be passed in when building an
	MALIGN. These are then used instead of the previous hardwired
	settings.
	
	Fixed a bug in affine_malign where the first rows of the F and G
	matrix were undefined meaning that the computation of G (gap in Y)
	used uninitialised data. This was the cause of sometimes giving
	daft alignments. The same bug probably exists in all the other
	alignment functions here, but has not been checked or fixed. 

	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.h:
	(15:57:12) Added destroy_malign_counts, malign_insert_scores and
	malign_recalc_scores functions. The latter of these allow for
	updating of the malign scores and consensus elements after a
	contigl list has been updated. Used as a fast alternative to
	rebuilding from scratch.
	
	Removed unused msegs element of MALIGN struct.
	
	Allow for gap_open and gap_extend to be passed in when building an
	MALIGN. These are then used instead of the previous hardwired
	settings.
	
	Fixed a bug in affine_malign where the first rows of the F and G
	matrix were undefined meaning that the computation of G (gap in Y)
	used uninitialised data. This was the cause of sometimes giving
	daft alignments. The same bug probably exists in all the other
	alignment functions here, but has not been checked or fixed.

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(15:16:58) Removed file descriptor 'leak' in write_reading(). 

2005-07-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/pregap4/modules/interactive_clip.p4m:
	(08:33:57) Fix for when the file of filenames contains space, so
	pregap4 works in the default windows install path. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(11:34:57) Fixed a bug in filter_tags. It now protects against
	MUT/HET tags being outside of the MCOV tag range. 

	* Version:
	(13:51:17) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(13:52:37) Updated to use tcl/tk 8.4.11 and a more official
	itcl/itk release (instead of a dated CVS checkout). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(13:53:08) Fixed MS Windows mouse wheel support 

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(13:53:45) Commenting only 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(13:54:54) mfopen now honours binary verses ascii differences (and
	so updated Read.c calls accordingly) so that Windows works better.
	
	Also improved append mode of opening. 

	* src/spin_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl:
	(13:56:02) Added an update call to resizebook; fixes dialogue size
	issues on Windows.
	
	Moved EMBOSS_DATA \ for / fix so that it doesn't error when
	EMBOSS_DATA is undefined. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(13:57:16) Use XGetImage with plane_mask as 1 (instead of
	AllPlanes) when on Windows. It gives b/w images, but prevents error
	dialogues commenting on "not implemented". 

	* src/windows/include/unistd.h:
	(13:58:03) Newer mingw seems better behaved, so the definitions of
	access *_OK macros are not protected around #ifdefs. 

	* src/windows/wix/README:
	(14:03:38) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/windows/wix/staden.wxs:
	(14:04:14) Main WiX setup for the Staden Package 

	* ChangeLog,

	basically allow for errors to be ignored. 

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.c:
	(08:41:16) Removed the warning for unknown chunk types. It now just
	silently stores them in memory. 

	* src/Misc/getfile.c:
	(11:20:08) Fixed expandpath() to not change //foo/bar to /foo/bar
	so that UNC pathnames work under Windows. 

2005-07-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/spin_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl:
	(11:13:41) Replace \ with / in EMBOSS_DATA path so that the
	environment set up by the default installation of EMBOSSwin works
	with Spin. 

2005-07-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(14:01:50) Fixed divide-by-zero buf when calling mfread for zero
	bytes. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(16:07:38) Fixed IO_LIB_* macros to be IOLIB_* macros. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db_main.c:
	(16:13:28) Added optarg/optind DLL waffle for windows. 

2005-07-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	(16:01:49) Put _WIN32 checks around the fcntl call in
	g_shutdown_database_. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(16:27:58) Removed rogue ^M

	* src/io_lib/scf/Attic/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/utils/Attic/Makefile.am,

	* src/io_lib/README:
	(09:10:19) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/include/Attic/os.h:
	(09:11:21) Removed the mkdir macro as it seems the current mingw
	has proper support for this. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Makefile.am:
	(09:12:18) Subsumed the other */Makefile.am files. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_tar.c:
	(09:12:48) On Windows, set stdout to be _O_BINARY. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(09:13:22) Fixed the _O_BINARY setting code on windows to check for
	fp being valid and to use the mf->fp instead of fp. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(09:15:30) Added checks for HAVE_SYS_WAIT_H for Windows handling. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(09:20:04) Moved HAVE_ZLIB_H from compress.c and put in os.h (when
	autoconf is not in use). 

	* src/io_lib/include/Attic/os.h:
	(09:20:05) Moved HAVE_ZLIB_H from compress.c and put in os.h (when
	autoconf is not in use). 

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c:
	(09:21:45) Changed bucket_pos from int64_t to int32_t (as was
	intended) so it works on windows correctly. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(09:22:50) Added more _O_BINARY checks for windows. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(09:23:28) Added error checking in open_trace_file(). 

	* src/io_lib/bootstrap:
	(10:28:38) Added to simplify initialisation of the autoconf system. 

	* src/io_lib/include/Attic/os.h,
	* src/io_lib/utils/os.h:
	(10:34:54) Moved os.h from include to utils.

2005-07-04  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(09:21:27) Switch to using a different zlib/png sub-makefile for
	solaris9. 

	* src/gap4/IO2.c:
	(09:23:11) Added include to get log_file prototype. 

	* src/eba/qual.c:
	(09:23:39) Updates to use	the new mFILE based I/O of io_lib. 

	* src/gap4/consen.c,

	* src/io_lib/scf/Attic/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/utils/Attic/Makefile.am:
	(09:25:34) Adjusted EXTRA_DIST definitions to only include files we
	still appear to have! 

	* src/io_lib/Attic/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Attic/Makefile.in:
	(09:25:51) (rebuilt) 

	* src/io_lib/read/Attic/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/scf/Attic/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/utils/Attic/Makefile.in:
	(09:25:52) (rebuilt) 

	* src/io_lib/Attic/config.h.in,
	* src/io_lib/Attic/configure:
	(09:26:33) (rebuilt) 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(09:27:05) Updated to use newer AC_INIT syntax. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(10:21:50) Made the default output format ZTR. Do not compress
	output (via gzip for example) if ZTR2 or ZTR3 is used. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(10:25:19) If HAVE_ZLIB isn't defined then the memgzip/memgunzip
	functions are now also not built (and hence removes compilation
	errors).
	
	The pipe2 function now uses waitpid to avoid zombies. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(10:29:41) Added mfrecreate() function to	change an existing
	mFILE to point to new data. Better handling of append mode in
	mfreopen. Fixed mf->fname such that it's now always a pointer to
	malloced data. Added mfdestroy to deallocate memory, but without
	flushing or closing file descriptors. Changed mfflush to write data
	regardless of whether it's stdin/stdout. This means that
	mfflush+mfdestroy can be used to close	 an mFILE without closing
	the underlying FILE pointer used. Added mftruncate. Rewrote mfread
	to do a single memcpy instead of   looped  memcpys. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(10:30:24) The .dir target is now hopefully more silent in
	operation. 

	* src/mk/solaris.cc.mk,
	* src/mk/solaris.gcc.mk:
	(10:31:14) Disabled BIOLIMS support by default. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.h,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c:
	(10:32:33) Added a -yticks option to draw lines at set intervals
	along the Y axis (ie horizontal lines). 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(10:33:46) Improved pyrosequencing re-alignment code. Use new mFILE
	io_lib structs.

	* src/abi/abiIO.c,
	* src/abi/abiIO.h:
	(09:08:18) Moved portions from getABIfield.c into this new file so
	that other tools can link with it. Ultimately this'll replace
	seqIOABI.c in io_lib. 

	* src/abi/Makefile,
	* src/abi/getABISampleName.c,
	* src/abi/getABIcomment.c,
	* src/abi/getABIdate.c,
	* src/abi/getABIfield.c:
	(09:09:04) Updated getABIfield to use abiIO.c (split off from it)
	and totally rewrote getABISampleName, getABIcomment and getABIdate
	to also use abiIO.c.

	* demo/gap4/Attic/traces.tar.hash,
	* demo/gap4/Attic/traces.tar.index:
	(09:40:36) Replaced the .index with a .hash file (created via
	hash_tar). 

	* src/get_scf_field/get_scf_field.c:
	(13:23:11) Updated to use mFILE and the new io_lib.

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES,
	* src/io_lib/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/README,
	* src/io_lib/dependencies:
	(13:33:14) Version 1.9.0-test
	
	* Significant speed ups, particularly when dealing with reading  
	gzipped files or when extracting data from tar files.
	
	* New external functions for faster access via mFILE (memory-file) 
	 structs. These mimic the fread/fwrite calls, but with
	mfread/mfwrite	 etc.
	
	* Some functions previously available in external scope, but not  
	defined in header files, have now been made internal only  
	("static"). Please contact me if you were using these and have a  
	burning need for them to remain external.
	
	* Numerous minor tweaks and updates to fix compiler warnings on
	more   stricter modes of the Intel C Compiler.
	
	* Preliminary support for storing pyrosequencing style traces. This
	  has been modeled on the flowgram data from 454, but should be  
	applicable to other platforms. ZTR has been updated to incorporate 
	 this too.
	
	  The Read structure also has flow, flow_order, nflows and flow_raw
	  elements too. Code to convert these into the more usual
	traceA/C/G/T   arrays exists currently as part of Trev (in tk_utils
	in the Staden	Package), but this may move into io_lib for the
	next official	release.
	
	* New hash_tar and hash_extract programs. These replace the
	index_tar   program for rast random access. For RAWDATA include
	"HASH=hashfile"   as an element to get io_lib to use the archive
	hash. It's possible   to create hash files of most archive formats
	as the hash itself   contains the offset and size of each item in
	the archive. This means   that extracting an item does not need to
	know the format of the	 original archive.
	
	  Some benchmarks show that on ext3 it's actually faster to extract
	  files from the hash than directly via the directory. This was  
	testing with ~200,000 files, whereupon directory lookups become  
	slow. I'd imagine ResierFS or similar to be faster.
	
	* Added an XRLE encoding for ZTR. This is similar to the existing
	RLE   mechanism but it copes with run length encoding of items
	larger than   a single byte. It's current use is for storing the
	4-base repeating   flow order in 454 data.
	
	* Potential incompatibilities:
	
	  - The Exp_info structure now has an "mFILE *fp" member instead of
	    "FILE *fp".
	
	  - As mentioned above, some functions are no longer external.
	These	  include many ctf functions, ztr_(de)compress,    
	ztr_chunk_(read/write), be_read_*, be_write_*,
	
	  - The default search order for RAWDATA is that the current
	directory     is searched after the rest of rawdata instead of
	before.
	
	  - Removed support for the old unix "pack" program as a
	compression	tool.

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.h,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(13:33:33) Version 1.9.0-test
	
	* Significant speed ups, particularly when dealing with reading  
	gzipped files or when extracting data from tar files.
	
	* New external functions for faster access via mFILE (memory-file) 
	 structs. These mimic the fread/fwrite calls, but with
	mfread/mfwrite	 etc.
	
	* Some functions previously available in external scope, but not  
	defined in header files, have now been made internal only  
	("static"). Please contact me if you were using these and have a  
	burning need for them to remain external.
	
	* Numerous minor tweaks and updates to fix compiler warnings on
	more   stricter modes of the Intel C Compiler.
	
	* Preliminary support for storing pyrosequencing style traces. This
	  has been modeled on the flowgram data from 454, but should be  
	applicable to other platforms. ZTR has been updated to incorporate 
	 this too.
	
	  The Read structure also has flow, flow_order, nflows and flow_raw
	  elements too. Code to convert these into the more usual
	traceA/C/G/T   arrays exists currently as part of Trev (in tk_utils
	in the Staden	Package), but this may move into io_lib for the
	next official	release.
	
	* New hash_tar and hash_extract programs. These replace the
	index_tar   program for rast random access. For RAWDATA include
	"HASH=hashfile"   as an element to get io_lib to use the archive
	hash. It's possible   to create hash files of most archive formats
	as the hash itself   contains the offset and size of each item in
	the archive. This means   that extracting an item does not need to
	know the format of the	 original archive.
	
	  Some benchmarks show that on ext3 it's actually faster to extract
	  files from the hash than directly via the directory. This was  
	testing with ~200,000 files, whereupon directory lookups become  
	slow. I'd imagine ResierFS or similar to be faster.
	
	* Added an XRLE encoding for ZTR. This is similar to the existing
	RLE   mechanism but it copes with run length encoding of items
	larger than   a single byte. It's current use is for storing the
	4-base repeating   flow order in 454 data.
	
	* Potential incompatibilities:
	
	  - The Exp_info structure now has an "mFILE *fp" member instead of
	    "FILE *fp".
	
	  - As mentioned above, some functions are no longer external.
	These	  include many ctf functions, ztr_(de)compress,    
	ztr_chunk_(read/write), be_read_*, be_write_*,
	
	  - The default search order for RAWDATA is that the current
	directory     is searched after the rest of rawdata instead of
	before.
	
	  - Removed support for the old unix "pack" program as a
	compression	tool. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/vlen.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/vlen.h:
	(13:35:42) vlen/vflen functions to estimate the maximum data size
	written out by a printf style function. This is used by the new
	mFILE functions. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(13:39:13) mFILE struct support. This is basically a set of
	functions to similulate stdio file support on a block of memory
	instead of a file, for purposes of speed and to avoid the need of
	writing data out to a file only to be opened and read back in again
	(which happened a lot before).
	
	stdio_hack.h is, like it says, a hacky bunch of #defines to turn
	stdio functions and io_lib functions into their mFILE equivalents.
	It is used internally to convert old code (eg ABI file reading) to
	use mFILE structures, but can also be used by the brave to update
	their own code. Use with extreme caution.

	* src/haplo/haplo_cons.c:
	(13:46:39) Handle asking for the consensus from zero templates. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(13:47:07) Handle asking for the consensus from zero templates. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c:
	(13:48:20) Moved the generation of "ungrouped" templates from C to
	Tcl (haplo::find_ungrouped). The reason is that in C we just have a
	list of templates covering the candidate SNPs and not a list of all
	the templates in the contig. 

	* src/gap4/clip.c:
	(15:53:41) Removed a 1-byte buffer overrun in the quality clip
	contig ends function. 

2005-06-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c:
	(13:20:09) The splitting code now returns a list of the templates
	should didn't make it into any group. This is now used by the tcl
	split-to-contigs code to produce a better "fake" sequence that
	includes these ungrouped readings.
	
	Also added a save consensus option to the right-click set menus.
	This saves the consensus of one or more groups and so removes the
	*requirement* to split contigs if you wish to just obtain the
	consensus. The ungrouped readings can optionally be included in
	that consensus output too. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(14:26:25) Added an option to save a fofn for reading names in a
	set. 

	* tables/haplorc:
	(14:27:18) Added fofn/consensus saving defs. 

2005-06-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c:
	(08:37:23) Added some simple hash table functions. Layered on top
	of these are HashFiles, which allow hash table indexing of files to
	be stored on disk. hash_tar and hash_extract test programs
	illustrate its use on tar files, much like index_tar does. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	(08:37:29) Added some simple hash table functions. Layered on top
	of these are HashFiles, which allow hash table indexing of files to
	be stored on disk. hash_tar and hash_extract test programs
	illustrate its use on tar files, much like index_tar does. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_extract.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_tar.c:
	(08:37:49) Added some simple hash table functions. Layered on top
	of these are HashFiles, which allow hash table indexing of files to
	be stored on disk. hash_tar and hash_extract test programs
	illustrate its use on tar files, much like index_tar does. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(08:38:22) Added support for integrating the new hashfile code via
	a "HASH=hashfile" RAWDATA setting.

	* src/g/g-io.c:
	(11:19:29) Fixed 32-bit file reading code for big-endian machines
	(eg Sun SPARC).

	* src/gap4/IO2.c,
	* src/gap4/io-reg.c,
	* src/tk_utils/text_output.c:
	(09:29:49) Improved the logging of register and deregister
	functions in Gap4. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db.c,
	* src/gap4/copy_db.h,
	* src/gap4/copy_db_main.c:
	(09:31:01) Added an option to omit tags when copying the database.
	This is just a simple hack to "fix" databases when the only thing
	broken is horrendously messed up tags. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(09:32:51) Better error checking in code used by disassemble
	readings and break contig. I've seen a couple tag corruptions
	recently that I've been unable to pin down - maybe this'll spot it! 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(09:33:23) Allow REG_QUERY_NAME to work even before the editor has
	fully started up. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(12:58:18) GUI changes to allow "sequence, consensus, both" as
	options for sequence search. 

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c:
	(13:01:45) Fixed various bugs in the search by sequence method.
	Forward searches in cutoff data sometimes missed hits in the cutoff
	data (when the sequence lengths vary greatly). Similarly reverse
	searches, even in used data, could miss matches too.
	
	Also added the ability to search in the consensus sequence. This is
	required for alignments like:
	
	seq1 AT-A	   seq1  GATATTA seq2 A-TA    or    seq2     
	TTAGGA cons ATTA	  cons	GATATTAGGA
	
	In both cases searching for ATTA needs to check the consensus (for
	different reasons). 

	* src/seq_utils/search_utils.c,
	* src/seq_utils/search_utils.h:
	(13:03:48) Added a prstrstr_inexact function. It's the same as
	pstrstr_inexact (pad-skipping strstr with inexact match), except
	for finding the last match instead of the first match. 

	* src/gap4/legacy_f2c.c:
	(13:04:22) Rebuilt from legacy.f 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(13:05:05) Added WHERE definition for search by sequence (for
	consensus vs readings) 

	* src/gap4/tagU1.c:

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(13:28:37) Added a STYLE parameter to control the display style for
	the trace. A new style known as PYRO is now present. This handles
	pyrosequencing traces whereby a single spike is present for each
	flash generated by incorporating 1 or more bases of a specific
	type.
	
	Due to this causing multiple bases at the same base, the
	trace_pyroalign function can x-scale the trace so that each base
	call has a separate column. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.h,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(13:28:38) Added a STYLE parameter to control the display style for

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(13:30:00) Added code to use -style pyro. 

	* src/gap4/readpair.c:
	(16:01:19) Find read pairs now positions the editor at the start
	(or ends) of the readings in question instead of the start/ends of
	the contigs. This means it works more appropriately for read-pairs
	indicating one contig is contained within the other. 

2005-05-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c:
	(09:31:09) Added back serial#= line in oligo tags at users
	requests. Also only list the various scores to 2 decimal places so
	the tag fits in the editor information line. 

2005-04-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl:
	(09:22:52) Complementing a contig now repopulates the contig list
	too so that the contig name changes in the list. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(10:59:33) Added MouseWheel support for X11 systems. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(11:01:30) Added horizontal mouse wheel support. For compatibility
	with tk text and listbox widgets this uses Shift-MouseWheel.
	Consequently the old Shift-Mousehweel (slow movement) has been
	replaced by Control-MouseWheel. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(11:32:03) Fixed bug #1183748. When copying consensus tags caused
	by breaking contigs the new tags now have the strand field set
	correctly. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(16:37:47) Disabled the controls and user visible components of set
	expansion and collapsing as this is still work in progress and I do
	not want knowingly bugged interfaces available to the users in the
	source tree. 

	* src/gap4/contig_id.tcl:
	(16:40:27) Fixed broken Return key binding. Oddly this rarely makes
	any difference as the okcancelhelp overrides return to hit the Ok
	button. 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(16:41:12) Fixed various cursor movement issues (and an incorrect
	number of lines returned from linesonscreen) when dealing with
	collapsed sets. 

	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c:
	(16:42:18) Removal of debugging output 

	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	(16:45:27) Removed a block of code dealing with changing tag types.
	When adding the newer GUI tags I managed to get text for edited
	tags to be thrown away when changing tag type, instead of unedited
	text. 

	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(16:45:49) Removal of debugging information.

	to their names). Sets are also now given background colours for
	their sequence names. 

	* src/Misc/parse_db.c:
	(16:10:33) A previous of allowing \" to escape quotes broke the
	subsequent backslash parsing for \n etc. Fixed.

	* src/g/freetree.c,
	* src/g/freetree.h,
	* src/g/g-db.c,
	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(09:33:38) Made the caching of freetrees an option in the Makefile
	and code that calls it. The freetree cache code is still out of
	date (as it doesn't yet support avl balance factors or the
	segregated lists) so for now it is disabled. 

	* src/tk_utils/sheet.c:
	(13:38:31) Added more Tk_IsMapped checks and assignments to
	sw->window. This may (untested) cure the intermittent crashes
	observed using redhat9 (with default? config of gnome + metacity)
	when bringing up the join editor.

	* src/g/freetree.c,
	* src/g/freetree.h,
	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(14:02:35) Added segregated lists to the freetree mechanism. This
	basically means a totally new tree_find_len() function and extra
	code to maintain the linked list segregations. Further
	experimentation may be needed to optimise the block rangers used
	within each list, but benchmarking shows this latest version to be
	way ahead of previous revision with regards to CPU time and also
	significantly less fragmentation (1/3rd less during assembly).

	* src/g/freetree.c,
	* src/g/freetree.h:
	(13:11:38) Added AVL tree balancing code. This increases
	performance greatly for some worst-case scenarios. However
	currently the freetree loading/saving code has been disabled as the
	balance factors need adding in somewhere. How to do this in a
	compatible way is unknown at present.

	"load_package gap" from trying to start up (and fail) Tk when
	DISPLAY isn't set.

	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(09:04:25) Removal of debugging output. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(09:05:17) Renamed group "by grouping" to "by set". 

	* tables/haplorc:
	(09:05:46) Added cursor colourings. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(09:27:38) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(11:27:37) Fix for warning about unsigned vs signed char *. 

	* src/haplo/tclIndex:
	(13:21:44) *** empty log message *** 

2005-03-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.c:
	(15:25:49) Added refs and sent_by fields of cursor structure to the
	tcl keyed list copy on CURSOR_NOTIFY events. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_cons.c:
	(15:27:10) Fixed the template depth calculation. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(15:28:12) Improved documentation. The plot now starts from zero
	for the contig ruler, with negative Y coordinates being the
	headings. Improved 'cursor' control. 

2005-03-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/haplo/Makefile,
	* src/haplo/haplo.h,
	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(15:16:50) First draft of haplotype/repeat splitting interface. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_cons.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_snps.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(15:16:51) First draft of haplotype/repeat splitting interface. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contigEditor.h,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edCommands.c,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(15:23:23) Added the notion of "sets" to the editor structures and
	GUI. This basically i a way of grouping readings into distinct sets
	and a way of showing only one set at a time in the editor.
	
	The plan is for sets to become more widely used, for breaking
	contigs apart, etc. 

	* src/gap4/Attic/allelic_discreps.c:
	(15:31:20) Probably last version and to be deprecated - just
	changed for some debugging / logging output. 

	* src/gap4/check_assembly.c,
	* src/gap4/fij.c,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/find_repeats.c:
	(16:11:39) Updated to change for the new argument syntax of
	edit_contig(). 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.h,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl:
	(16:18:34) Renamed the existing discrepancy plot to be a "diploid
	descrepancy" plot and added a new discrepancy plot that excludes
	the code to check if the frequency matches an expected 50/50 ratio. 

	* src/Makefile:
	(16:56:11) Added haplo subdirectory. 

	* src/gap4/io-reg.c:
	(17:17:13) It's scary to notice oddities with the low-level contig
	registration scheme after all these years. The contig_notify system
	when given contig 0 as a placeholder meaning "all contigs" now
	sends over the correct contig number when calling the callback
	functions rather than zero. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(17:19:18) Addition of a contig_lock_write tcl interface. Also
	updated the discrepancy plot arguments (-two_alleles). 

	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(17:19:54) Addition of a contig_lock_write tcl interface. Also
	updated the discrepancy plot arguments (-two_alleles). 

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(17:22:09) In process_discrep the confidence values are now
	computed in a marginally different way (same maths, but more
	robust). Computing "number close to 1" and then doing 1-that gives
	precision problems, but computing the 1-value directly yields more
	accurate results. Consequently the confidence scores can be much
	higher without data precisison truncation. 

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c:
	(17:23:16) Changed calls to calc_quality due to contEd_info
	prototype change. 

	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.c:
	(17:24:17) Added REG_LENGTH support and cursor locking calls for
	the tcl interface to io-reg. 

	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.h:
	(17:24:38) Added REG_LENGTH support and cursor locking calls for
	the tcl interface to io-reg. 

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(17:26:03) Took out the limit of only being able to remove virtual
	sequences from a virtual contig. We can now populate it with real
	sequences and remove real sequences that we do not wish to be in
	the computed consensus (for example). Also removed some debugging
	output. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(17:28:04) Fixed usage output. 

	* src/pregap4/pregap4,
	* src/spin/spin,
	* src/trev/trev:
	(17:29:02) Added MACHINE support for linux-ia64. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(17:30:42) Added support for a -trace_scale option in trev (and
	report usage too). In the widget this overrides the auto-scaling to
	maxTraceVal. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.h:
	(17:30:43) Added support for a -trace_scale option in trev (and
	report usage too). In the widget this overrides the auto-scaling to
	maxTraceVal. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c,
	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(17:30:44) Added support for a -trace_scale option in trev (and
	report usage too). In the widget this overrides the auto-scaling to
	maxTraceVal. 

	* src/tk_utils/user_defaults.tcl:
	(17:31:20) Removal of debugging output. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(17:32:21) *** empty log message *** 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(17:32:22) *** empty log message *** 

	* tables/haplorc:
	(17:32:51) First version of the config for the haplo gap4 package. 

2005-03-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/copy_db.c:
	(16:24:56) Added code to fix the min..max size of templates (if min
	> max). 

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(16:31:52) Highlight disagreements by dots now uses ":" to display
	bases that differ but are below the quality threshold. 

2005-03-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/tman_display.c:
	(11:54:27) Fixed "embedded traces" in the Join Editor. 

2005-02-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(16:49:43) Changed mask variable sent to find_repeats so that
	masking repeats actually does something. 

2005-02-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(10:08:03) Added getABIIndexEntrySW and modified getABIString to
	correctly determine the string type (pascal vs C-string). This
	means MODL numbers now come out as 3730 instead of 730 (for
	example). 

2005-02-04  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(14:21:47) Fixed a bug in the reading to contig number caching
	caused by joining the last contig in the database to another. 

	* src/gap4/seqInfo.c:
	(14:25:00) Removed a memory leak and a potential free of an
	undefined pointer. 

2005-01-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/sheet.c:
	(12:31:04) Fixed bug #1105931.
	
	Initialise the sw->window to zero in sheet_create. This means that
	starting the join editor on the default (ie "next") match for Find
	Internal Joins on the demo/gap/DEMO.0 database does not crash on
	Windows.
	
	I do not know why the lack of initialisation was so data specific
	and OS specific. Valgrind reports no problems on linux and in
	theory this is correct (as sw->window shouldn't be accessed until
	after it's been initialised for real, due to Tk_IsMapped calls
	elsewhere). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(15:06:31) Added auto-scrolling when dragging out a selection
	beyond the boundaries of the editor text widget. 

2005-01-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(10:25:32) Fixed bug #1104453. We now fill out the qual2
	"2nd-highest confidence" array when using the base frequencies or
	weighted base frequencies algorithms. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c:
	(11:40:32) Fixed bug #1104446.
	
	When the user configures the contig editor width to be different to
	the default the display was drawn at the default width until the
	next resize event. 

2004-12-06  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Misc/vlen.c:
	(17:25:45) Moved va_list variable into the #ifdef block so that the
	variable is only declared when used. 

	* src/gap4/consen.c:
	(17:31:54) Addec ctype.h include for prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/extract.c:
	(17:35:34) Removal of unused variables. 

	* src/gap4/gap_utils.tcl:
	(17:37:03) Optimisations of obtaining reading names and getting the
	left most reading (quicker now to convert to contig number and read
	left-most rather than chain left). 

	* src/gap4/oligo.h:
	(17:39:09) Added createTmpAnnotation prototype. 

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(17:41:18) Removal of unused variables. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(17:41:58) Corrected minor compiler warnings. 

	* src/mk/linux.mk:
	(17:43:47) Added -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to enable 64-bit file
	offset support. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_pcr.c:
	(17:45:08) Used %"PRId64" instead of %ld for printf of
	(casted)strlen result. This is the official C9X syntax. 

	* src/prefinish/tooltips.tcl:
	(17:51:44) Temporary fix - catch{} the tooltip_font creation as the
	contig editor may also have created this font. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkSheet_common.c:
	(17:53:05) Cancel the idle call of the SheetDisplay function when
	destroying a sheet widget. This fixed a race condition triggerable
	by scripts (but apparently not in gap4 itself) whereby SheetDisplay
	could get called on a destroyed sheet. 

	* tables/config.prefinish:
	(17:53:50) An improved "prefinish" GUI config. 

	* src/gap4/IO.c,
	* src/gap4/IO.h,
	* src/gap4/io_utils.c,
	* src/gap4/io_utils.h:
	(17:55:18) Added a cache of reading-number to contig-number
	conversions. The rnumtocnum and chain_left functions now use this
	in prefernce to taking a brute-force approach. There are also
	functions for update_rnumtocnum and invalidate_rnumtocnum to ensure
	this information does not become inconsistent. 

	* src/gap4/IO2.c,
	* src/gap4/IO3.c,
	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c,
	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(17:56:26) Added calls to update_rnumtocnum and
	invalidate_rnumtocnum to make sure the new cache of reading numbers
	to contig numbers is kept in sync. 

	* src/gap4/preass.c:
	(17:56:27) Added calls to update_rnumtocnum and
	invalidate_rnumtocnum to make sure the new cache of reading numbers
	to contig numbers is kept in sync. 

	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl:
	(17:56:50) A major rewrite of UpdateContigList; it is now
	substantially faster. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(17:57:50) Added a get_contig_nums sub-method to the db_info
	command (in addition to the existing get_contig_num call). Some of
	the other db_info methods now return 64-bit results. 

	* src/gap4/template_display.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.h:
	(17:58:16) CalcTotalReadingLen, CalcTotalContigLen and
	CalcLongContig now all return 64-bit data types. 

	* src/gap4/dbcheck.c:
	(17:59:34) We now check the rnumtocnum cache in memory matches the
	GContigs and GReadings structures. This checking code also
	auto-corrects any problems it finds (in addition to complaining
	about them). 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(18:00:21) Use Tcl wide() cast to display 64-bit integers (now
	returned from db_info). 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl:
	(18:02:22) Tags added to canvas items are now also stored in a hash
	(indexed by contig number). This provides a substantially faster
	way to lookup canvas items for a specific contig number. (The
	canvas findtag methods appear to be O(N^2) complexity for N canvas
	items.) 

	* src/gap4/auto_assemble.c:
	(18:08:55) Added calls to update_rnumtocnum and
	invalidate_rnumtocnum to make sure the new cache of reading numbers
	to contig numbers is kept in sync. 

2004-11-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO2.c:
	(14:58:36) Replaced memcpy with memmove in io_delete_contig.
	Somehow it used to work anyway, but was presumably
	compiler/C-library dependant. 

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(14:59:40) Removed a redundant call to destroy_alignment_params
	which was causing memory to be freed twice and giving malloc
	problems. 

2004-11-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/io_utils.c:
	(09:24:16) Massive speedup of lget_contig_num changing it from
	O(N^2) to O(N) in complexity. The offending double-loop sped up by
	100,000 times when run on 50000 contigs from 2.6million reads. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(09:25:32) Used PRId64 for printf type in db_info so that functions
	returning int64_t get passed back to Tcl correctly. 

2004-11-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/Makefile,
	* src/g/dependencies,
	* src/g/freetree-io.h,
	* src/g/freetree.c,
	* src/g/freetree.h,
	* src/g/g-db.c:
	(09:49:40) Added support for 64-bit offsets in AUX files. This
	means that Gap4 databases can be larger than 2Gb. Support for
	32-bit is still maintained for backwards compatibility.
	
	The main heart of this is to redefine the GImage data type to be an
	8-byte integer and to split the functions in g-io pointed to by
	low_level_vectors into 32-bit and 64-bit versions. 

	* src/g/g-debug.c,
	* src/g/g-error.c,
	* src/g/g-error.h,
	* src/g/g-filedefs.h,
	* src/g/g-files.c,
	* src/g/g-io.c,
	* src/g/g-io.h,
	* src/g/g-os.h,
	* src/g/g-request.c,
	* src/g/g-struct.c,
	* src/g/g-struct.h:
	(09:49:41) Added support for 64-bit offsets in AUX files. This
	means that Gap4 databases can be larger than 2Gb. Support for
	32-bit is still maintained for backwards compatibility.
	
	The main heart of this is to redefine the GImage data type to be an
	8-byte integer and to split the functions in g-io pointed to by
	low_level_vectors into 32-bit and 64-bit versions. 

	* src/Misc/os.h:
	(09:56:17) Added int8 type and corresponding swapping functions.
	Also added printf macros, if missing, (for %ld, %d, %lld, etc) as
	defined by C9X. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db_main.c:
	(09:57:34) Added a -b option to define the output database bitsize
	(for the aux file). Also rewrote the argument parsing to use
	getopt() instead. 

	* src/gap4/f2c.c,
	* src/gap4/legacy.f:
	(09:59:06) Split the swritf function into a series of swrt1, swrt2,
	etc functions. Each of these are identical interfaces to the same
	underlying function, but from fortran we make sure to never call
	the same function with a different number or different type of
	arguments (as fortran technically doesn't support varargs). This
	removes the compiler warnings from g77. 

	* src/gap4/gap-create.c,
	* src/gap4/gap-create.h,
	* src/gap4/gap.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(10:00:27) Added support for 64-bit aux files. 

	* src/mutlib/array.hpp:
	(10:02:59) Worked around a problem (a real bug perhaps? or maybe
	just a compiler oddity) when compiling with gcc 3.4.
	
	If template A contains protected members and template B derives
	itself from template A, then we cannot directly access the
	protected members of A within B. Instead we need to explicitly
	specify the template search path or use this->member. 

2004-11-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/enter_tags.tcl:
	(11:28:50) Fixed typo causing Tcl error in Enter Tags. 

	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	(11:29:38) Consensus tags now honour the unpadded_tags switch. 

2004-11-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(12:10:16) Major speed up of reading large experiment files. Tested
	on a 1Mb sequence with AV, ON and SQ lines the new code is 1000
	times faster on the Alpha.
	
	Primarily the difference comes from removing O(N^2) complexities by
	removing strcat & strlen type of operations. 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c:
	(14:23:26) Major speed improvements in plot_confidence() for qual
	arrays that contain runs of the same value. In this case we
	collapse the items into a single horizontal ruler. On test projects
	this seemed to give 10-20 fold speedups of plotting and subsequent
	canvas operations. 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c,
	* src/gap4/consistency_canvas_box.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c:
	(15:41:58) In lots of places we sprintf to command strings to pass
	over to Tcl. Those involved with scale factors (eg scaling down
	10Mb to 600 pixels) often up with as .000???, so the default %f
	format loses precision. These have been changed to %.20f (and the
	buffer sizes checked to make sure they cope).
	
	This corrects a bug with displayed positions in the gap4
	consistency plots not matching those shown in the contig editor,
	and probably many other similar bugs too. 

	* src/gap4/gap_canvas_box.c,
	* src/gap4/plot_quality.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(15:41:59) In lots of places we sprintf to command strings to pass
	over to Tcl. Those involved with scale factors (eg scaling down
	10Mb to 600 pixels) often up with as .000???, so the default %f
	format loses precision. These have been changed to %.20f (and the
	buffer sizes checked to make sure they cope).
	
	This corrects a bug with displayed positions in the gap4
	consistency plots not matching those shown in the contig editor,
	and probably many other similar bugs too. 

	* src/tk_utils/canvas_box.c,
	* src/tk_utils/element_canvas.c,
	* src/tk_utils/ruler_tick.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkRaster.c:
	(15:42:05) In lots of places we sprintf to command strings to pass
	over to Tcl. Those involved with scale factors (eg scaling down
	10Mb to 600 pixels) often up with as .000???, so the default %f
	format loses precision. These have been changed to %.20f (and the
	buffer sizes checked to make sure they cope).
	
	This corrects a bug with displayed positions in the gap4
	consistency plots not matching those shown in the contig editor,
	and probably many other similar bugs too. 

	* src/gap4/stop_codon.c:
	(17:10:55) Removed the limitations on the maximum number (was
	10000) of stop codons found. 

	* src/spin/nip_stop_codon.c:
	(17:11:09) Removed the limitations on the maximum number (was
	10000) of stop codons found. 

	* src/gap4/stop_codon.c:
	(17:34:26) Fixed a bug with all stop codons beyond the unpadded
	length being "modulo"d back to the start of the contig. Stops at
	the end now appear correctly.

2004-11-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* staden.login,
	* staden.profile:
	(17:55:25) Added IA64 support for MACHINE. 

	* src/Misc/Makefile:
	(17:56:22) Automatically create the lib/$MACHINE-binaries
	directory. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(17:56:23) Automatically create the lib/$MACHINE-binaries
	directory. 

	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.c,
	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.h:
	(17:57:52) Added a get_protein_lookup() method to avoid direct
	access to the protein_lookup global. This resolves gcc -O2
	compilation woes using mingw on MS Windows. 

	* src/spin/readpam.c:
	(17:58:32) Now uses get_protein_lookup() instead of accessing the
	global protein_lookup variable. 

	* src/windows/run/Makefile:
	(17:59:09) Added -mwindows to gcc line; this prevents the DOS box
	from appearing at start up. 

	* src/windows/wix/generate_wxs.pl:
	(18:04:02) Lots of new features: auto-generation of GUIDs, file
	associations, menu support, improvements for long/short filenames,
	others? 

	* ChangeLog:

2004-11-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* Makefile:
	(09:28:04) Updated make dist targets. "lib" is now common only as
	binaries are copied during the src dist target. 

	* README.build:
	(09:28:35) Updated build instructions. 

	* lib/Makefile:
	(09:29:49) Updated tablelist version to copy for distrib building. 

	* src/Makefile:
	(09:30:38) More distrib building changes. 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(09:31:31) Now checks out a specific dated version of itcl (equiv
	to the Windows 3.3 build). 

	* src/prefinish/Makefile:
	(09:31:56) Updated distsrc target. 

	* Makefile:
	(16:28:05) More distrib building tidyups. 

	* Version:
	(16:28:33) The time for a new release approaches! 

	* src/Makefile:
	(16:28:57) Distrib building updates. 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(16:29:24) Fix itcl/iwidgets builds (to work with the cvs checkout
	version). 

	* src/tk_utils/help_choose.tcl:
	(16:30:50) Auto now looks for mozilla first. 

	* lib/phrap/phrap.tcl:

2004-10-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/mk/linux-ia64.mk:
	(10:24:23) Itanium/gcc support. 

	* doc/manual/tools/update-nodes:
	(10:32:30) Use $0 when finding update-nodes.el so that calling this
	script from other directories (eg ../scripting) still works. This
	fixes a bug introduced in the last modification to this file. 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(10:41:39) Use .built-$(O) instead of .built so we can
	clean/rebuild for different OSes in the same source tree. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(10:42:10) Automatically create binary output directories. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(10:42:46) Fixed bug with the right-click menu (it didn't exist!) 

2004-10-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(09:02:28) Allow for backgrounds to be blank, to disable it. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(09:03:56) Set the default background colour list to "" (ie just
	the usual grey). 

	* lib/Makefile:
	(09:15:53) Various updates for distribution building 

	* src/Makefile,
	* src/mutlib/Makefile,
	* src/tk_utils/Makefile:
	(09:15:56) Various updates for distribution building 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(15:27:28) A new Makefile to download, compile and locally-install
	the required third party packages. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(16:53:29) Compile and link against root/src/lib instead of
	root/lib. 

2004-10-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/spin_emboss/acd2tcl.tcl:
	(09:31:16) Updated to work with the latest ACD specification used
	in Emboss 2.9.0. This meant adding toggle and directory types. 

	* src/spin_emboss/create_emboss_files.tcl:
	(09:32:35) Updated to look for ACDs in share instead of share/data
	(change meaning it works with emboss 2.9.0). 

	* src/spin_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl,
	* src/spin_emboss/tclIndex:
	(09:33:44) Added an init_dialogue function and other bits to cope
	with the new implicit "acdprotein" variable. Now works with emboss
	2.9.0. 

	* tables/emboss_menu:
	(09:35:58) Regenerated from emboss 2.9.0. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(10:46:29) Improved the choice of background colours. Thanks Nancy!

	* doc/scripting_manual/Makefile:
	(15:39:12) Changed to generate pdf instead of PostScript.

2004-10-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/abi/getABIfield.c:
	(11:10:28) Added a line-separator control. 

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c:
	(13:18:45) Added the ability to find tags with confidence 0 or 100
	in the "edit" search. 

	* doc/manual/tools/texi2man.pl:
	(13:24:30) Corrected SEE ALSO expansion to find _fxref() instead of
	@fxref{}. 

2004-10-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(15:38:18) Added a "-subtract <amount>" option to allow removal of
	a specific DC offset. 

2004-10-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/acd2tag.tcl:
	(09:14:49) "variable:" records are now read and written to the tag. 

2004-10-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(14:15:12) Changed the default value for -ignore_vec on
	assemble_direct as it appears that I had the backwards compatible
	behaviour backwards. 

2004-10-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(16:45:37) In guess_references we now look for best quality
	"differing" traces against either strand, rather than only
	top-strand. This helps with hets when maybe top & bottom strand
	both get difference base calls. 

2004-10-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(14:47:16) Added a "show read-pair traces" option to the editor.
	This controls whether the opposite strand trace for this template
	should be automatically shown when invoking the trace display.
	
	Also, for contig_editor.tcl only, added mousewheel support. 

	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(14:47:34) Added a "show read-pair traces" option to the editor.
	This controls whether the opposite strand trace for this template
	should be automatically shown when invoking the trace display.
	
	Also, for contig_editor.tcl only, added mousewheel support. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(14:49:06) Fixed a divide-by-zero error in the normalisation code. 

	* src/tk_utils/text_output.c:
	(14:49:46) Better handling of verror/vmessage usage when Tk hasn't
	been initialised. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:50:11) Added mousewheel support. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(14:50:38) Added "Show Read-pair Traces" to the editor settings
	menu. 

2004-10-07  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/mutlib/trace.cpp:
	(16:16:01) Downscale to +/-16384 when differencing traces (instead
	of the previous 32768) as not all displays cope correctly with
	trace samples > 32768. 

	* src/mutlib/align.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/mutscan.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/mutscan_analysis.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/mutscan_preprocess.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/sp_align_lib.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/tracealign.cpp:
	(16:17:16) Removal of debugging information. 

	* src/gap4/tman_diff.c:
	(16:20:19) Changed the Y-scale algorithm to use the normalization
	code from convert_trace. This works much better. 

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(16:21:20) If auto-diff is enabled but no negative references have
	been found, we now automatically pick the best discrepant template
	and use that instead. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(16:21:51) Shortened the "title" attached to difference traces. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(16:24:21) Added CONTIG_EDITOR.NAMES_XPOS option to control the
	default scrollbar position in the editor sequence names display. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(17:16:41) sort_seq_by_template() is now a stable sort. Call
	sort_seq_by_strand prior to calling by template so that sequences
	within a template are now always listed in +/- strand order. 

2004-10-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(16:10:54) Allow the default editor-names X scrollbar position to
	be set in the gaprc file. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(16:14:02) The reference sequence is now forced to be top whenever
	the sequences are grouped by anything other than position. (For now
	this cannot be done with group-by-position as this HAS to be sorted
	by position for searches to work correctly.) 

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(16:15:16) When auto-diff is enabled but no references have been
	set, gap4 now still always brings up the top and bottom strand
	sequences instead of reverting back to only the trace you
	requested. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(16:16:07) When the editor names panel is showing template names
	instead of reading names, the trace display now does the same. 

2004-10-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(10:56:07) Rewrote rescale_heights (the "-normalise" option) using
	an amplitude tracker with an attack & delay model. This seems to
	work well at adjusting for both gradual amplitude variations and
	for downscaling huge dye-blobs. 

2004-09-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* Version:
	(13:52:30) *** empty log message *** 

	* ChangeLog:
	(14:03:44) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(14:43:59) Change directory now (via some naughty internal hacking)
	clears the filebrowsers "last rememembered directory". 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/readpair.c,
	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(16:17:44) Fixed displaying/listing of template sizes for the
	"<---- .... ---->" case. Previously these could be considered as
	consistent is the ABS(end-start) value was correct, but we now take
	notice of t->direction for working out end-start vs start-end
	instead of using ABS(). 

2004-09-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/Attic/allelic_discreps.h:
	(10:35:38) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/f2c.h:
	(10:38:54) *** empty log message *** 

2004-09-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/acd2tag.tcl:
	(16:28:27) Added "namespaces" into tags. These get converted into
	multiple tabs so that the tag contents can be duplicated up to
	produce subtags within a single tag.
	
	Added text and label data types. 

	* src/gap4/Attic/allelic_discreps.c:
	(16:29:31) Main allelic_discreps function now returns a tcl list
	instead of just spewing to stdout. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(16:32:17) Editor sequence-name panel now remembers the X scrollbar
	position between contig editor uses (within a single session).
	
	Experimental "tag popup" system. Currently only suitable for the
	inhouse ExoSeq project and so disabled in the default gaprc.
	
	"Show template names" option to toggle whether reading names or
	template names are shown in the left name panel.
	
	The "Join to" function now attempts to automatically complement a
	contig if required (based on read-pair primer types). 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c:
	(16:32:46) Addition of edSetTemplateNameMode/edGetTemplateNameMode
	functions. 

	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(16:34:30) Code for toggling the sequence-name and template-name
	shown in the left names panel. 

	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(16:34:31) Code for toggling the sequence-name and template-name
	shown in the left names panel. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(16:35:32) Use of CONTIG_EDITOR.SEARCH.AUTO_EDIT_TAG to determine
	whether a tag search automatically brings up the tag editor to view
	it. 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(16:36:02) 4.10b4 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(16:36:27) allelic_discreps now returns a Tcl list to the caller
	containing the results. 

	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU1.c,
	* src/gap4/tagUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	(16:39:26) The edit/create annotation code now returns (from C to
	Tcl) the Tk pathname of the newly created window.
	
	CONTIG_EDITOR.MACRO_AUTOEDIT used to determine whether the tag
	editor should be launched after creation of a tag via a macro.
	
	Bug fix to the GUI tag creation code (tag name vs typeid issues). 

	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c:
	(16:40:34) The xview method now returns the current slider position
	when no arguments are given. 

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(16:41:30) Added xx->template_names check to determine whether to
	view sequence or template names. 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(16:46:09) Various toggles (STRAND_COVERAGE.PROBLEM.VALUE,
	CONTIG_EDITOR.LIST_CONFIDENCE.ONLY_NUM_ERRS) plus new menus/options
	for new features ("show template names" in editor, tag popups for
	ExoSeq project). 

	* tables/shlib.conf:
	(16:46:24) Added linux-ia64 support. 

2004-09-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/extract.c:
	(15:43:51) Fixed a bug where the filenames extracted did not match
	the contents of the file. An extract followed by a directed
	assembly did not reveal problems as the filenames are irrelevant -
	the contents of the filenames were all present still (but in wrong
	files). 

2004-08-17  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Misc/parse_db.c:
	(13:27:50) Allow backslashes for escaping quotes (and obviously
	therefore also backslashes themselves). 

	* src/gap4/acd2tag.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	(13:34:36) Added "gui tags". This uses a hacked copy of the emboss
	acd->tcl conversion code, but specifically it is designed for
	generating gui frames instead of entire top-level windows.
	
	Any tag type with a default-text starting in "#!acdtag:" is
	considered to be in an ACD-like syntax and the default text then
	describes the format instead of the tag text contents. 

	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(13:35:16) Added acd2tag::parse lookup 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(13:37:17) Added a ztr_dump program. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(13:38:02) Fixed the auto-directory making target. 

2004-08-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/abi/Makefile,
	* src/abi/getABIfield.c:
	(16:31:14) Complete rewrite of the ABI file reading code so that it
	can now load directly from in-memory structures.
	
	This is within getABIfield.c which is now a general purpose abi
	dump and so replaces all the other getABI* programs. 

2004-08-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_order.tcl:
	(09:20:00) Added missing file for "Order Contigs" code. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/index_tar.c:
	(09:32:05) Fix bug submitted by Steve Leonard. If a directory is
	too large to fit in the name (>100) but short enough to fit in the
	prefix the name field will be empty, this is not the cas for
	ordinary files where the name field is always non-empty. 

2004-07-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(10:28:13) Binary output directories are now automatically made.

	* src/gap4/oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/oligo.h,
	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(10:53:51) Added a "prev" button to the contig editor's "select
	primer" interface. 

2004-07-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Misc/vlen.c:
	(10:39:25) Added a va_copy call in vflen for systems where va_list
	is a pointer. The NEED_VA_COPY define comes from the system
	specific bits of os.h 

	* src/Misc/os.h:
	(10:41:28) Define NEED_VA_COPY macro for amd64 systems. (see vlen.c
	for its use) 

2004-07-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* doc/manual/tools/update-nodes:
	(11:38:51) From Gintautas Grigelionis.
	
	Updated the search path for the update-nodes.el script. (uses
	$STADENROOT/manual.) 

	* src/mk/linux.mk:
	(13:02:38) Added comments for alternative options needed on AMD64
	systems. 

	* src/primer3/src/Makefile:
	(13:04:17) Added SHLIB_CFLAGS to the primer3 library building code. 

2004-07-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(11:37:13) more diagnostic output on templates: score, consistency,
	flags. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	(11:38:22) When -no_consensus is true we now still set
	fin->vc->cons. This means that link_vrseq will no longer complain.
	
	Updated version to 1.31

	Reapplied local patches to listbox.tcl, palette.tcl, tkfbox.tcl and
	xmfbox.tcl. Local patch to tearoff.tcl is no longer needed (it made
	it into the core dist.) 

	* lib/tk/images/README,

2004-06-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap_hash.c:
	(12:56:51) Find Repeats now depads the sequence first. (Func
	repeat_search) 

2004-06-24  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(14:12:56) Fixed the Save button. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(15:56:06) Improved text output to indicate both left and right
	contig ends where known while splitting. 

	* src/gap4/break_contig.c:
	(15:56:07) Improved text output to indicate both left and right
	contig ends where known while splitting. 

	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(16:13:34) Removed the add_tag_menus function. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(16:16:31) The editor 'edit tag' and 'delete tag' sub-menus now
	auto-cascade when there are too many tags visible at one point. 

2004-06-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(10:12:01) Added TEMP_CONSIST_INTERDIST as a type of error
	indicating that the size constraint on a template has been broken
	when we attempt to butt contigs against one another (working on the
	assumption that any valid overlap would have been made already).
	The TEMP_OFLAG_INTERDIST flag can be set to enable this search to
	be made (which is off by default; previously it was enabled and
	produced CONSIST_DIST errors).
	
	Added template_check_set_flags() function to ease setting a flag
	for all templates in the template_c array. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(10:14:35) Added TEMP_OFLAG_INTERDIST flag to template_c structs.
	Necessitated by the change in template.c in order to keep behaviour
	in edUtils2.c the same as the previous revision. 

	* src/gap4/template_display.c:
	(10:17:02) Added comment about using TEMP_OFLAG_INTERDIST. It's not
	enabled here, but this means it has an operation different to the
	previous version (as template.c has changed, not this file). 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c:
	(10:18:06) Splitted the template status code "D" into "D" and "d".
	Uppercase indicates impossible distance issues (ie negative size)
	and lowercase indicates less severe out of range sizes. 

2004-06-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(09:04:17) Check for the alignment buffer introducing more pads
	than the sequence length dictates there should be. This was causing
	read-past-end of buffer (depad_to_pad[]) in some rare cases and
	hence causing the join editor align button to hang or crash. 

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(09:28:05) Join editor "Align" button output now trims the right
	hand alignment edge (for runs of pads) in addition to left end. 

2004-06-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/io-reg.c:
	(13:46:57) Improved debug info to log file. 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.h,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(13:48:45) Added new graph types and added the allelic_discreps Tcl
	binding (meant to be in last update, but missed). 

2004-06-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/eba/Makefile,
	* src/eba/conf.c,
	* src/eba/conf.h,
	* src/eba/qual.c:
	(08:28:55) Added secondary phred-scale lookup table from
	callibration of new confidence assignment mode. 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl:
	(15:56:41) Added a catch around a visibility wait as in some cases
	it errors. Unknown why! 

	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.c,
	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(15:58:53) Added template to the gel_info query. 

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(16:00:06) Added a visual cue of the contig length and the match
	position within that contig. 

	* src/gap4/Makefile,
	* src/gap4/Attic/allelic_discreps.c,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c,
	* src/gap4/qual.c,
	* src/gap4/qual.h:
	(16:08:27) New discrepancy calculations and plots computed via
	calc_consensus and calc_discrepancies. The second-highest
	confidence may be returned from calc_consensus() if cons2 is passed
	as NULL but qual2 is not. This is plotted via the 2nd-highest
	confidence graph.
	
	A new function calc_discrepancies(), based on calc_consensus,
	computes the second highest confidence value at each base position
	along with an estimation of how likely it is that we have two
	haplotypes fitting a 50/50 ratio.
	
	The allelic_discreps function (currently exported to Tcl, but with
	no user interface) uses calc_discrepancies to attempt to pull apart
	an assembly mixed from two haplotypes. 

	* src/gap4/Makefile:
	(16:40:37) Rewrote all calls to the FORTRAN WRITE() call from
	legacy.f as SWRITF() instead. This is our own function (in f2c.c)
	designed to act much like a printf style command. The purpose of
	this is to allow f2c generated code (legacy_f2c.c) to work without
	needing any of the fortran run-time library and hence make building
	on platforms without a fortran compiler substantially easier to do. 

	* src/gap4/f2c.c,
	* src/gap4/legacy.f,
	* src/gap4/legacy_f2c.c:
	(16:40:38) Rewrote all calls to the FORTRAN WRITE() call from
	legacy.f as SWRITF() instead. This is our own function (in f2c.c)
	designed to act much like a printf style command. The purpose of
	this is to allow f2c generated code (legacy_f2c.c) to work without
	needing any of the fortran run-time library and hence make building
	on platforms without a fortran compiler substantially easier to do. 

	* src/gap4/quality_plot.c:
	(16:42:58) Replaced fmtdb_ in fortran with a local fmtdb, to avoid
	requirements of fortran WRITE() call. 

	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c:
	(16:43:50) Add tag pointer into Tk window pathname. It's a hack,
	but it means that multiple tags with tagid 0 (newly created ones)
	can be edited without clashes. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(16:44:35) Fixed error message for TraceCmd. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(16:46:44) Added new consistency/confidence graph menu items. 

	* tables/trevrc:
	(16:47:36) Use trace "orig_format" instead of "format" widget
	command when determining type to save under. This means that we can
	edit and save back to experiment files once more (ie fixes a bug). 

2004-06-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c:
	(16:19:00) Improved the cryptic warning messages output by FIJ. 

2004-06-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/eba/conf.c,
	* src/eba/qual.c:
	(17:30:48) Added various command line options to turn on/off
	averaging and to turn on a "filtered" method of calling confidence
	values. Enabling both this and the old method takes the minimum of
	either in a "pessimistic" approach. 

2004-06-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:11:52) Added gui component/defaults for "ignore svec clips" in
	directed assembly. 

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c:
	(14:15:25) Added an "ignore svec (SL/SR) clips" option to directed
	assembly. The default behaviour (not ignore) is how the 2003 staden
	package worked, but not 1.4 and 1.4.1. 

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.h,
	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(14:15:29) Added an "ignore svec (SL/SR) clips" option to directed
	assembly. The default behaviour (not ignore) is how the 2003 staden
	package worked, but not 1.4 and 1.4.1.

	(08:54:43) Updated notes to claim this is version 1.8.12 and
	rebuilt all the automake/autoconf/libtool generated files. 

	* src/io_lib/abi/Attic/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/alf/Attic/Makefile.in:

	rebuilt all the automake/autoconf/libtool generated files. 

2004-05-24  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c:
	(08:42:47) Improved information added to oligo tags: now has Tm,
	GC, quality. 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c:
	(08:53:13) Add force_comment call to edSetBriefTag(), meaning that
	tag searches now update the information line correctly. 

2004-05-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(15:54:14) Added keybindings to use XF86_Switch_VT_1 in addition to
	Shift-Key-F1 (and so on) as this appears to be how the newer
	XFree86 default xmodmap is configured.
	
	Unfortunately XF86_Switch_VT_1 is only in XFree86's keysymdb,
	meaning that using a linux xserver and a (for example) digital unix
	client will still work as Gap4 on digital unix cannot bind to an
	unknown keysym. 

2004-05-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(16:14:10) Improved spacing fix. 

2004-05-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(08:27:40) Applied change suggested by Saul A. Kravitz. The
	fallback fspacing is now calculated over the range that basecalls
	exist rather than the total length of trace. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c:
	(13:35:43) Fixed incorrect repositioning of the editor window when
	new plots were brought up. Caused due to the CONTIG_REG
	notification triggering a CURSOR_NOTIFY event using the editor
	internal sequence number instead of the external reading number. 

2004-05-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl,
	* src/gap4/gap.tcl,
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c,
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.h,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(08:42:13) More template check parameters are now exposed to the
	user via the Configure menu. Specifically this includes what data
	we filter out as possibly incorrect (prime type; all or just
	custom) and the minimum length of vector SVEC tags before we
	consider them to be valid. (Both are in template.c already, but
	previously only controlled programatically.) 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(08:43:10) Corrected OFLAG flags so that they are proper
	bit-patterns rather than 'overlapping' each other causing bugs. 

	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(08:43:11) Corrected OFLAG flags so that they are proper
	bit-patterns rather than 'overlapping' each other causing bugs. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(08:44:28) Added default definitions for the new template status
	checking options. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(08:44:54) Renamed the template size tolerance function to
	something more appropriate. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(08:46:23) Added a "Join to..." menu to the editor names panel.
	This brings up a join editor between the current sequence and the
	one linked to (provided they are in different contigs). 

	* staden.login,
	* staden.profile:
	(10:24:56) Updated the MANPATH handling to use the "manpath"
	command where available for finding the default. 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(12:28:00) SF Bug #914027. The sequence search now honours the
	start/end ranges. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(13:41:09) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(14:11:41) Added an "orig_format" widget command 

	* src/tk_utils/xyesno.tcl:
	(14:12:53) Improved packing layout. 

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(14:15:58) Version 1.8b1.  Use trace "orig_format" command instead
	of "format" for working out if the trace is experiment file or not.
	This corrects a bug caused by the io_lib change of 2004-01-13
	whereby EXP files were considered to be in the format of the trace
	file they referenced by trev and hence could not be saved to. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(14:17:40) Made the various new template checking tweaks (minimum
	vector length, chk_template_stats, ...) available as a script-level
	configuration. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:18:50) Set the default Sequence Search percentage match to be
	100% (was 75%). 

	* ChangeLog:
	(14:19:52) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/tk_utils/utils.tcl:
	(16:44:47) SetCurFrame now takes a list of frame and successive
	GetCurFrame calls now cycles through the list. The practical upshot
	is that the "join contig" dialogue can now automatically switch to
	the next frame when the contig selector is used to pick contigs. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(16:46:37) Made use of the new SetCurFrame and GetCurFrame
	semantics so that using the contig selector is easier for selecting
	the two contigs needed for join contigs. 

2004-05-07  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Makefile:
	(13:10:58) xrelink target to do the same as relink, in case relink
	is overloaded elsewhere. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(13:12:36) Reenabled the Any-Configure binding once more. It
	probably breaks resizing in some cases, but without it twm was
	giving zero sized windows.
	
	One day... one day, I'll finally get around to rewriting this mess! 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(13:13:29) Improved usage messages and error messages when DISPLAY
	not set.
	
	Updated version to 4.10b2 

	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(13:16:55) Added a minimum length of vector (min_vector_len) to
	consider as valid, in order to ignore a few base pairs erroneously
	tagged at the end of sequences due to random matches. (This is a
	bug in vector clipping programs, but it happens often.)
	
	Added a TEMP_OFLAG_IGNORE_PTYPE flag so that the primer type
	information can be completely ignored when trying to work out
	template positions. Instead it relies purely on the location of
	sequences and vector tags. This is to work around databases with
	incorrectly entered data. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(13:18:45) Edited TEXTUTILS_LIB definition to have TEXTUTILS_LIB_E
	at the end, rather than second to end. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.c:
	(14:44:53) Renamed key_t to fkey_t to avoid conflicts under MinGW. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_hash.c:
	(15:24:19) Reduced the spamminess of the best oligo match output by
	only printing up failed ones. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c:
	(15:25:56) Added extra min_vector_len parameter into
	finish_clip_svec call. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(15:28:20) Check for the new -penalise_overlaps option.
	
	Set TEMP_OFLAG_IGNORE_PTYPE flag the template struct before
	checking for validity if -chk_template_stat == 0. Pass over the
	-min_vector_len parameter too. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	(15:29:13) Extended the -ends only mode to give scores for
	improving low quality, even though it still only tries to extend
	contigs. Added a -regexp_templates 1 option to switch back to the
	previous default mechanism. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.c:
	(15:30:23) Make use of the -min_vector_len option in the
	find_cloning_cector and finish_svec_clip functions. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.h:
	(15:30:39) Make use of the -min_vector_len option in the
	find_cloning_cector and finish_svec_clip functions. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(15:35:06) Decreased the impact of primer3 scores on the
	'cost_mult' parameter. It's now *= 1+score/50 instead of *=
	1+score/20.
	
	When -chk_template_stat == 0 we now set the template ranges to be
	the observed location of vector +/- 1Kb.
	
	"Solution not adjoining problem end" is now multiplicative in cost
	rather than additive.
	
	Tweaks for start location of where to search for primers when we're
	trying to solve a + strand problem from the right end (ie the left
	end failed) and where start != end. We back up from the requested
	pos by half a read length. 

	* src/scripts/embl2exp:
	(16:25:26) New script: a quick hack to convert EMBL to EXP by using
	a gap4 database as an intermediate format. 

2004-04-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/seq_utils/search_utils.c:
	(09:21:45) Fixed a 'read past buffer end' bug in pstrstr and
	pstrstr_inexact, leading to possible crashes, but more likely to
	false matches being reported.
	
	The problem occured when 'text' ended in a pad. 

2004-04-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/notes.c:
	(10:38:24) Fixed a 1024 byte limitation on the RAWD note. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(10:46:45) Added -quality parameter quality_clip_ends funct. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db.c:
	(10:47:09) Added a copy_read_name() function. This now handles
	duplicate readings by renaming them. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(10:48:47) New template colour definition (-tmplcolour5) to match
	the spanning template status. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(10:49:11) *** empty log message *** 

2004-04-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl:
	(13:28:28) Renamed the term 'template size strictness' to 'template
	size tolerance' to reflect the fact that larger numbers mean less
	strict. 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(13:28:40) Renamed the term 'template size strictness' to 'template
	size tolerance' to reflect the fact that larger numbers mean less
	strict. 

	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c,
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.h,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(13:28:41) Renamed the term 'template size strictness' to 'template
	size tolerance' to reflect the fact that larger numbers mean less
	strict. 

	* src/gap4/template_display.tcl:
	(13:28:42) Renamed the term 'template size strictness' to 'template
	size tolerance' to reflect the fact that larger numbers mean less
	strict. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(13:29:51) Renamed the term 'template size strictness' to 'template
	size tolerance' to reflect the fact that larger numbers mean less
	strict. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(13:30:25) Added TEMPLATE_TOLERANCE as a configuration parameter so
	that users may adjust the default from 1.0. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(13:54:03) Changed the primer3 Tm settings back to their previous
	ranges. These are probably inappropriate for the PCR dialogue, but
	I'll tackle that later (with a different set of parameters
	perhaps). 

2004-04-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/clip.c:
	(16:23:35) Updated the quality_clip_ends function to output using
	vmessage() instead of printf. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(17:01:05) Added editor colour for spanning template 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h:
	(17:03:27) Added a new colour code and status for templates in the
	editor. "Spanning" templates now have the status "O" ("O"ther
	contig). Templates that are spanning and have only one end-read
	present are shown with a pink block. Currently spanning templates
	where both-ends are present and correct are still shown in the "Ok"
	colour, although the text code still lists "O". 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(17:03:28) Added a new colour code and status for templates in the
	editor. "Spanning" templates now have the status "O" ("O"ther
	contig). Templates that are spanning and have only one end-read
	present are shown with a pink block. Currently spanning templates
	where both-ends are present and correct are still shown in the "Ok"
	colour, although the text code still lists "O". 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.h:
	(17:03:29) Added a new colour code and status for templates in the
	editor. "Spanning" templates now have the status "O" ("O"ther
	contig). Templates that are spanning and have only one end-read
	present are shown with a pink block. Currently spanning templates
	where both-ends are present and correct are still shown in the "Ok"
	colour, although the text code still lists "O". 

2004-04-19  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/mk/alpha.mk:
	(11:24:56) Added F77_DEP so that gap4sh compiles. 

	* tables/checked.gif,
	* tables/unchecked.gif:
	(12:58:00) Added missing image files for the PCR primer picking
	code. 

	* src/gap4/pcr_primers.tcl:
	(12:58:26) Moved location of checked/unchecked gif images to
	$STADTABL. 

	* tables/Makefile:
	(12:59:20) Added *.gif to the list of extensions to copy using make
	dist. 

2004-04-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/restriction_enzymes.c:
	(16:15:34) The correct fragment size is now listed between mouse
	clicks in the plot. 

	* src/gap4/stop_codon.c:
	(16:16:22) Stop codons are now spotted when they contain pads
	within the codon. The reading frame no longer changes due to pads
	either. 

	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.c,
	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.h:
	(16:17:12) Added iubc_word_match_padded() for use with the depadded
	stop codon plot. 

	* src/seq_utils/renz_utils.c:
	(16:18:27) Added hash_seq4_padded() to hash on word length 4 in
	data containing pads. This was created for the gap4 stop-codon plot
	updates and it pretty much works OK, but in the end I decided not
	to use it. 

	* src/tk_utils/restriction_enzyme_map.c:
	(16:19:11) Added an unpadded_cut_site parameter to PlotStickMap.
	Required by the gap4 restriction enzyme plot changes. 

	* src/tk_utils/restriction_enzyme_map.h:
	(16:19:27) Added an unpadded_cut_site parameter to PlotStickMap.
	Required by the gap4 restriction enzyme plot changes. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkSheet_common.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkSheet_struct.h:
	(16:21:22) Added a 'grid' member of the sheet widget to control
	whether Tk_SetGrid should be used. This allows us to only specify
	one widget to be controlling the grid within a toplevel (which is
	supposedly required by Tk, despite the fact that we've used 2
	within the contig editor for ages). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(16:24:00) Disabled "gridding" (resizing in steps quantised to the
	font size) within the editor and adjusted the Any-Configure event
	handler.
	
	This means that the editor can now display half a character, or
	that the vertical scrollbar grows/shrinks to fit in an exact number
	of characters.
	
	However it does cure some horrible resizing bugs when running on
	RedHat9 using metacity (I believe the problem is with metacity, not
	redhat9 or gap4) and generally resizing has been buggy for a long
	while. Hopefully this produces fewer problems than it solves. 

2004-04-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(09:23:15) Removed a database corruption caused when a reading is
	removed from the database (not just moved) and then no subsequent
	write of the main GT_Database record is performed. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(09:23:59) *** empty log message *** 

2004-04-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(10:32:26) Updated comments regarding MMAP speed tests 

	* src/mutlib/Makefile:
	(10:42:55) CFLAGS vs CXXFLAGS name 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(10:43:29) Include <string.h> for Solaris C++ 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(10:44:44) Changed default filtering options 

	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	(10:47:19) Change to reflect local sanger ntemplates used (3 to 2). 

	* src/scripts/assemble4:
	(10:48:52) Remove -f in "stash -f" 

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl:
	(10:55:28) Added a template strictness option. This controls how
	far outside the min-max template size a template can be before
	being flagged as inconsistent 

	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c,
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.h,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(10:55:29) Added a template strictness option. This controls how
	far outside the min-max template size a template can be before
	being flagged as inconsistent 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(10:56:18) Menu items for the new template strictness function and
	the gap4 PCR interface. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(10:57:31) Added definitions for gap4 PCR interface, changed the
	default primer picking parameters, added the colour for the
	"ends-not-present" template staus in the editor, and the 'do not
	show inconsistent templates' template display option. 

	* src/gap4/template_display.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.h,
	* src/gap4/template_display.tcl:
	(10:58:55) Added an option to turn off display of inconsistent
	templates. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.h:
	(11:00:54) A new template status code (E) and colour have been
	added. This shows when a template is consistent, but one or both
	"end sequences" are not present and so the position has not been
	experimentally verified. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(11:01:35) Made raising of the search window option. The new
	bindings in contig_editor.tcl no longer raise the window when page
	up/down is used. 

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(11:02:25) Initialise the GReadings structures and vseq_t
	structures. (Bug fix for uninitialised data.) 

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c:
	(11:02:34) Initialise the GReadings structures and vseq_t
	structures. (Bug fix for uninitialised data.) 

	* src/prefinish/finish_reverse.c:
	(11:02:35) Initialise the GReadings structures and vseq_t
	structures. (Bug fix for uninitialised data.) 

	* src/gap4/pcr_primers.tcl:
	(11:03:24) Gap4 GUI to the prefinish code to pick PCR primers
	between contig ends. Preliminary version. 

	* src/prefinish/Makefile,
	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_pcr.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_pcr.h:
	(11:04:32) Added interface to using primer3 for PCR picking;
	initially just between contig ends. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.h:
	(11:05:18) Generalised the filter functions to work on any sequence
	rather than hand-coded members of the finish_t structure. Used by
	the new PCR picking code. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(11:05:45) Moved score_match2() from finish_walk.c to
	finish_utils.c and renamed to secondary_primer_match(). 

	* tables/NOTEDB:
	(11:06:28) Created a new note type FAKE. This is used in the
	prefinishing system to mark sequences that should not contribute to
	strand analysis (eg consensus sequences). 

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(11:06:29) Created a new note type FAKE. This is used in the
	prefinishing system to mark sequences that should not contribute to
	strand analysis (eg consensus sequences). 

	* src/tk_utils/help_choose.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/help_galeon.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/help_netscape.tcl:
	(11:07:19) Added more options for the web browser to use for online
	help. Konqueror, mozilla and galeon are now supported. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(14:00:11) *** empty log message *** 

2004-04-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/ng_fb_cmds.tcl:
	(10:17:11) Honour the no_csel command line option when opening new
	databases via File->Open 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(10:31:48) The default position for the main window when starting
	up gap4 with a database specified on the command line is now
	underneath the contig selector window. 

	* src/mk/linux.mk:
	(10:34:08) Changed gcc/g++/g77 names to exclude the version number
	(suggestion by Joe Burks). 

	* src/Misc/misc.h:
	(10:42:22) Surround getopt prototype with ifdef _MSC_VER. (Joe
	Burks) 

	* mklinks:
	(10:48:11) Added link in scripting_manual to ../manual/tools. Added
	explicit "." as the destination for ln as SGI ln does not accept
	this as a default. 

	* doc/manual/tools/make_ps:
	(10:53:32) Changed the default location of 'convert' program. We
	still specify the full path to avoid confusion with the staden
	package 'convert' tool. (idea from Joe Burks) 

	* doc/manual/tools/edit_mini_contents.pl:
	(10:54:14) Changed default location of perl to /usr/bin/perl (idea
	from Joe Burks) 

	* doc/manual/tools/html_index.pl,
	* doc/manual/tools/merge_indexes.pl,
	* doc/manual/tools/remove_xrefs.pl,
	* doc/manual/tools/texi2html,
	* doc/manual/tools/texi2man.pl,
	* doc/manual/tools/xref_update.pl:
	(10:54:15) Changed default location of perl to /usr/bin/perl (idea
	from Joe Burks) 

	* course/texi/Makefile:
	(14:35:25) Changed @tick{} and @cross{} macros for m4 _tick() and
	_cross() implementations. This avoids the need for makeinfo and
	hence also avoids problems with no .txt copies of images. 

	* course/texi/course.texi,
	* course/texi/exercise1.texi,
	* course/texi/header.m4:
	(14:35:26) Changed @tick{} and @cross{} macros for m4 _tick() and
	_cross() implementations. This avoids the need for makeinfo and
	hence also avoids problems with no .txt copies of images. 

2004-04-06  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(11:30:47) Added a createTmpAnnotation function and a
	create_tmp_anno editor subcommand to utilise it. This is used for
	displaying fake annotations (eg it was previously done via C-only
	in the "suggest primers" option of the contig editor). 

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl:
	(11:33:18) Cosmetic changes to the "edit oligo parameters"
	dialogue. 

	* src/gap4/primlib.c,
	* src/gap4/primlib.h:
	(11:35:05) Added "num_return" as a configurable (from tcl) primlib
	parameter.
	
	Added primlib_choose_pcr function. 

2004-03-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/consen.c:
	(08:56:23) Allow ambiguity codes to be written to FASTA files. Not
	technically correct according to the original fasta spec, but no
	one seems to care about that these days. 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	(09:07:24) Moved a declaration to the start of a block (as it was
	an accidental C++ism). 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(09:08:28) Moved inexact_pad_match function to earlier in file to
	avoid missing prototype complaints. 

	* src/gap4/gap_utils.tcl:
	(09:09:15) Cosmetic formatting change. 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(09:10:03) Moved "int length" to start of block to avoid C++ism. 

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(09:11:50) Added _select_region function (which should have been
	checked in with the last round of editor updates). 

2004-03-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/html_library.tcl:
	(11:25:37) Removed the focus hack which broke when tk was updated
	to 8.4 (it gave rise to an infinite recursion). 

	* src/tk_utils/help_choose.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/tclIndex:
	(11:26:33) Changed how the help mechanism is chosen. 

	* src/pregap4/gui.tcl,
	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(11:27:53) Removed the 'beta' component of the program version
	number. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(11:35:15) *** empty log message *** 

2004-03-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(16:08:01) Added tcl interface to the list_base_confidence command. 

	* src/gap4/qualIO.c,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.h:
	(16:10:02) New functions for producing distributions of phred
	scores for bases that match and mismatch the consensus sequence.
	illed by signal 2. 

	* src/gap4/qual.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(16:10:40) Tcl dialogue for the list base confidence command 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(16:12:40) Added List Base Confidences to view menu. 

2004-03-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(12:00:13) Added an interface to editor_select_region. This marks
	(underlines) a selection, for visual view and for use with create
	tag etc. 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(12:01:27) Matches displayed in the editor are not automatically
	selected, for faster tagging.
	
	The search by tags mode now also matches in padded sequence. 

2004-03-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(11:57:05) Fixed a buffer overflow (and general inefficiency) in
	calling the depadding code. 

2004-03-10  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(14:07:34) Added a consensus consistency quality array (in qual2)
	for the bayesian consensus algorithm. This is designed to indicate
	likely alignment conflicts. 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.h,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(14:09:59) Added consensus discrepancy as a plot type in the
	"consistency display". This uses the new discrepancy part of the
	consensus algorithm. 

	* src/gap4/consistency_display.h:
	(14:10:56) Added consensus discrepancy as a plot type in the
	"consistency display". This uses the new discrepancy part of the
	consensus algorithm. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl,
	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c,
	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:12:48) New editor search mode: search by consensus discrepancy 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(14:13:25) Added consensus discrepancy as a plot type in the
	"consistency display". This uses the new discrepancy part of the
	consensus algorithm. 

	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(14:14:49) Exported InputSelectReadingList and added "Highlight
	reading list" on to the main Lists menu. 

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl:
	(14:16:48) Renamed "save" to "save order" to avoid confusion with
	saving the list itself to disk. 

2004-03-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(12:42:02) Added a new option to allow the highlight disagreements
	mode to be filtered by base quality. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(12:42:20) Added a new option to allow the highlight disagreements
	mode to be filtered by base quality. 

2004-03-04  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(16:33:39) Added -no_filter and -no_consensus options for
	optimising picking of only resequences (where dust and consensus is
	not needed).
	
	Also moved the regexp #ifdef for processing the skip_templates and
	avail_templates files to be a run-time option (-regexp_templates). 

2004-03-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(14:54:03) Recent fix to open_db broke creation of new databases.
	Now check that the failure code from access() is EACCES and not
	ENOENT. 

	* src/mutlib/Makefile,
	* src/mutlib/align.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/array.hpp,
	* src/mutlib/caller.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/list.hpp,

	* src/mutlib/trace.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/trace.hpp,
	* src/mutlib/tracealign.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/tracealign_helper.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/tracediff.cpp:
	(17:02:25) Updates to work with "Compaq C++ V6.5-035".
	Specifically: Use <locale> instead of <cctype> for toupper. Use
	assert(pointer != NULL) instead of assert(pointer). 

	* src/mutscan/Makefile:
	(17:03:09) Added Tk to link line. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp,
	* src/mutscan/stringlist.cpp:
	(17:04:03) Use assert(pointer != NULL) instead of assert(pointer)
	to remove warnings from the Compaq C++ V6.5-035 compiler. 

	* src/tracediff/main.cpp:
	(17:04:24) Use assert(pointer != NULL) instead of assert(pointer)
	to remove warnings from the Compaq C++ V6.5-035 compiler. 

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(17:45:52) Treat Read->basePos as 16-bit, which means hard-coding
	the first two bytes in ztr_encode_positions for each pos as zero. 

	* src/Misc/dstring.c:
	(17:46:48) "int" vs "size_t" so we can check the -1 return code
	from dstring_find(). 

	* src/g/g-request.c:
	(17:47:42) Remove compiler warning by using appropriate signness
	check in next_edtime(). 

	* src/gap4/IO2.h,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.c:
	(17:48:26) Corrected missing prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/clip.c:
	(17:48:54) Corrected missing prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.c:
	(17:51:04) The check for a tag type being known when picking the
	colour to draw (wrongly) always succeeded, but it chose the default
	colour anyway. Now the check has been removed, as the default
	colour is an appropriate method. (ie just a compiler warning
	removal.) 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(17:51:33) Version incr. 

	* src/gap4/io_utils.h:
	(17:52:35) Prevent compiler warnings caused by the gel_read macro
	always returning 0 (success), but being used in an "if
	(gel_read...)" context. Added a check for gelnum > 0 in order to
	provide a valid return code for the macro. 

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(17:53:25) Fixed memory leak (not calling destroy_alignment_params)
	and reordered code slightly to remove an inconsequential compiler
	warning. 

	* src/mk/alpha.mk:
	(17:54:07) Changed default compilers to the Compaq cc/cxx/f77. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(17:55:41) Use system installed png.h instead of local hack. 

	* src/tk_utils/Attic/png.h:
	(17:56:28) Removed to allow system version to be picked up. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(18:00:23) *** empty log message *** 

2004-03-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(17:26:01) Fix log files. Do not generate when the DB does not
	exist. Works better in read-only directories. 

2004-03-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/help_choose.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/html_library.tcl:
	(10:30:28) The help_choose mechanism was broken due to having all
	the help_* files listed in the tclIndex. tcl-internal now also
	works too (removed the tkFocusOK function which was causing a
	auto-load loop as the official one is now ::tk::FocusOK; I do not
	think we needed the modified version anyway). 

	* src/tk_utils/tclIndex:
	(10:30:29) The help_choose mechanism was broken due to having all
	the help_* files listed in the tclIndex. tcl-internal now also
	works too (removed the tkFocusOK function which was causing a
	auto-load loop as the official one is now ::tk::FocusOK; I do not
	think we needed the modified version anyway). 

2004-02-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(16:56:01) On the first database write after a flush Gap4 will
	check the global time stamp in the Aux header to make sure that the
	disk copy matches it's own cached in-mory copy.
	
	The rationale behind this is that users still manually remove the
	BUSY file because "they know best". They then act all suprised when
	their database becomes corrupt. Our alternative here is to check
	the master time-stamp in the Aux header and to simply abort Gap4
	(losing all unsaved edits) if it has been changed external to this
	process.
	
	This still leaves room for race conditions (multiple people editing
	simultaenously), but it covers the more common case of a gap4
	session left open for ages and then going back to it later. 

	* src/g/g-files.h,
	* src/g/g-request.c,
	* src/g/g-struct.c,
	* src/g/g-struct.h:
	(16:56:02) On the first database write after a flush Gap4 will
	check the global time stamp in the Aux header to make sure that the
	disk copy matches it's own cached in-mory copy.

	* src/g/g-files.c:

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c,
	* src/gap4/fij.c,
	* src/gap4/fij.h,
	* src/gap4/fij.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(12:36:19) *** empty log message *** 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(13:54:56) Added the default alignment length to display to the
	gaprc file. 

2004-02-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c:
	(16:06:01) Modified the align_blocks function once more, using the
	1.2 copy as a starting point, but with the same ideas from the
	latest version regarding allowing overlapping blocks. Scoring for
	overlapping blocks has been changed so that the length portion that
	overlaps is ignored. Block length/position adjustment to remove the
	overlaps has been moved from align_wrap into align_blocks. 

2004-02-24  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap-error.c:
	(09:33:43) Changed bug email addr to sourceforge url 

	* src/gap4/clip.c,
	* src/gap4/clip.h,
	* src/gap4/clip.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(16:18:04) Added a "quality clip contig ends" function to trim back
	low quality data off the end of contigs. The purpose is to correct
	for phrap assemblies where clipping is typically done based on
	disagreements, and disagreements at the very end when depth=1 do
	not happen. This leads to 'rubbish' being at the contig end,
	devaluing the FIJ with "hidden data" turned off. 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(16:18:05) Added a "quality clip contig ends" function to trim back
	low quality data off the end of contigs. The purpose is to correct
	for phrap assemblies where clipping is typically done based on
	disagreements, and disagreements at the very end when depth=1 do
	not happen. This leads to 'rubbish' being at the contig end,
	devaluing the FIJ with "hidden data" turned off. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(16:19:07) Allow trace display linewidth to be a configurable
	parameter. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(16:29:39) *** empty log message *** 

2004-02-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c:
	(16:58:43) Fixed swapped reseq_nsolutions and long_nsolutions
	parameters. 

2004-02-19  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(12:13:52) Fixed typo in LG qualifier (was LF). 

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.h:
	(13:48:59) More type fixes; EFLT_LG was given the same number as

2004-02-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(10:23:31) Fixed a bug in the handling of DB_FLAG_INVIS and
	sequences being out of order due to clip-point adjustment. Hidden
	readings could be used for the consensus and unhidden would be
	skipped. It now uses _DBI_order() to resolve this. 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(11:18:54) Updated version number. 

	* src/tk_utils/Makefile:
	(11:25:06) Added an explicit "." to the ln commands as SGIs do not
	allow for default to the current directory. 

	* src/text_utils/Makefile:
	(11:25:59) Added an explicit "." to the ln commands as SGIs do not
	allow for default to the current directory. 

	* src/tracediff/Makefile:
	(11:50:09) Added an explicit "." to the ln commands as SGIs do not
	allow for default to the current directory.

	(09:18:33) Latest changelog summary, plus removal of email
	addresses. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(09:22:54) Added TK_LIB to TEXTUTILS_LIB definition as on some

	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/undo.c:
	(09:59:23) Fixed undo so that nested OpenUndo and CloseUndo work as
	expected (ie Undo undoes the outermost block and not the
	innermost). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:

	or even between contigs (between editors). 

	* LICENCE.txt:
	(10:27:00) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(10:29:01) Added filtering for clusters of tags, as these are

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c,
	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.h:
	(14:39:52) Added LG (LiGation) to experiment file definition. 

2004-02-03  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/IO2.c,
	* src/gap4/enter_tags.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h,
	* src/gap4/preass.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU2.c,
	* src/gap4/tagUtils.h:
	(09:43:30) add_tags and enter_tags now allow for tags to be input
	in unpadded coordinates. 

	* src/gap4/gap-dbstruct.h:
	(09:43:46) Fixed comment for Nfreerecs. 

	* src/copy_reads/copy_reads.c:
	(09:58:11) Updated call of create_tag_for_gel. 

2004-01-27  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(10:17:09) Remove duplicates from fofn before disassembling as they
	cause infinite loops. 

	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.c:
	(16:43:48) Add the 'contig busy' dialog to the quit_displays
	function so that disassemble readings and break contig have more
	visible error conditions. 

2004-01-22  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(11:52:46) Changed the dependent_table[] to increment by 7
	initially instead of 8 so that the scores mirror the old version
	more closely. 

2004-01-21  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	(10:18:07) Commented out previous change to do with lockf on the
	database file. This is causing databases to claim they are locked
	when they are not. I believe this is due to problems with NFS lockd
	when machines crash and not getting an up to date cache of the lock
	status. 

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(10:18:10) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl:
	(10:18:27) Dead code removal. 

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(10:19:53) David Harper spotted an inconsistency in the consensus
	calculation. When a pad is in a column depend_add[depth] is added
	per extra base (typically 8 per base, and then reducing bit by
	bit). When a pad is not in a column it adds 7*depth for all depth.
	
	The code now always uses the former array lookup method. 

	* src/tk_utils/config.tcl:
	(10:24:03) Updated font selector window. 

	* tables/tk_utilsrc:
	(10:24:50) Changed all unix font defs to use pixel sizes instead of
	point sizes. 

2004-01-14  The Badger Set [sc3]  <badger>

	* src/prefinish/Makefile,
	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA_ends_only:
	(10:29:14) Updated make install and added the ends_only config
	script. 

2004-01-14  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/tk_utils/user_defaults.tcl:
	(14:52:29) When loading up *rc files, source *rc.local too if it
	exists. This allows for easy installation of site-specific
	configurations. 

	* src/tk_utils/user_defaults.tcl:
	(14:54:26) Fixed a bug in the new .local code. 

	* src/seqed/Group.itcl,

2004-01-13  Mark Griffiths  <mng>

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(09:22:51) Fixed trace flash for trace display. 

2004-01-13  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(17:02:00) In read2exp only set the file format to be TT_EXP when
	'redirection to trace' is not enabled (ie it indicates where the
	sequence came from, EXP or SCF/ZTR/...). 

	* src/gap4/consen.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(17:13:24) Save consensus now has the option to use the left-most
	template name instead of left-most reading name as the contig
	identifier. This is useful primarily for cDNA based projects. 

	* src/gap4/consen.h,
	* src/gap4/consen.tcl:
	(17:13:25) Save consensus now has the option to use the left-most
	template name instead of left-most reading name as the contig
	identifier. This is useful primarily for cDNA based projects. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(17:13:52) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(17:14:48) Positions are now listed in the "goto..." menu from the
	editor names. 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	(17:16:25) We now use lockf() on the database file itself (DB.V,
	not DB.V.aux), thus preventing corruptions causing by manually
	removing the BUSY file. 

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(17:16:47) We now use lockf() on the database file itself (DB.V,
	not DB.V.aux), thus preventing corruptions causing by manually
	removing the BUSY file. 

	* src/tk_utils/misc.c:
	(17:22:07) Updated the tk Motif-style filebrowser to be MUCH faster
	(x80) by using the dir_or_file command from tk_utils (which was
	reimplemented to use Tcl_Obj and take a list as the argument). 

	* lib/tk/xmfbox.tcl:
	(17:22:30) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(17:24:10) Removed blank -avail_template_file argument. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_hash.c:
	(17:25:49) Compare primer now checks for the sequence to hash being
	shorter than the hash word length, in order to avoid for hashing
	error messages. 

	* Version:
	(17:26:47) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(17:27:11) Update to version 4.9test3 

	* ChangeLog:
	(17:33:09) branches:  1.13.2; *** empty log message *** 

2004-01-12  Mark Griffiths  <mng>

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(11:17:20) fixed bell before raising dialog. 

2004-01-12  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(10:35:03) Added a two-pass method to generate_experiments. Pick
	the most appropriate end for single-stranded experiments (as
	before), but if that fails we now work outwards from the other end
	too. This helps to pick experiments when our contig is covered
	entirely by a single-stranded region. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(10:35:44) We no longer rely on t_start1 and t_start2 when the
	template is inconsistent as the template positioning information
	may be invalid. Using min/max instead. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	(10:35:53) Updated version number. 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(11:47:45) Corrected guessing of template boundaries for
	"complemented" templates. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(12:35:54) Apply a cost increase to experiments that do not connect
	to at least one end of the problem region.
	
	The reason being that a problem from 1-1000 with reading length 600
	can be solved in 2 experiments, but chosing the first experiment
	(due to minor reasons like better primer) from 200-800 requires 2
	extra experiments to solve it. 

2004-01-09  Mark Griffiths  <mng>

	* doc/manual/dependencies,
	* doc/manual/gap4-t.texi:
	(14:19:12) contig navigation help added. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h:
	(14:21:15) Added -nojoin to edit_contig command , returning path to

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(14:21:44) Added contig navigation menu to View menu. 

	* doc/manual/contig_navigation-t.texi,
	* doc/manual/Attic/contig_navigation_browse.unix.gif,
	* doc/manual/Attic/contig_navigation_table.unix.gif:
	(14:24:36) Contig navigation help files. 

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(14:25:21) Contig navigation interface. 

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(15:53:06) Fixed next/previous bug and added error checks on
	contigs not found.

	* src/tk_utils/text_output.c:
	(16:13:56) Include hostname in the log_file output 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(16:14:28) Fixed more tag corruptions from disassemble readings. 

2003-12-16  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(16:54:09) Version incr. 

	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	(16:55:33) Improved error reporting of tag input. 

	* src/mutlib/array.hpp,
	* src/mutlib/caller_base.cpp:
	(16:56:27) Floating point error checking: divide by zero and
	log(0). 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(16:58:28) Remove checking of template consistency. 

	* src/tracediff/main.cpp:

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(12:06:48) Added new "group by" methods to the editor. In addition
	to the original "group by templates" we can group by strand, clone,
	name, number and position.
	
	Also fixed a bug in the "go to" function to jump to alternate reads
	on a template. After a join the cached contig number could be
	invalid, so the contig number is calculated on the fly. 

	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c:
	(12:08:00) Improved the align_blocks() function.
	
	(In some cases this caused the join editor "align" command to not
	work.) 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(12:09:17) check_template_length_overlap() has been rewritten to
	more correctly figure out if a template is inconsistent between two
	contigs. It now checks for primer inconsistencies, eg where two
	forward readings exist, but not at the same position or in
	differing orientations. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(12:10:36) Added "group by" options for the contig editor. 

	* staden.profile:
	(12:11:00) Removed "bash"isms. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(12:13:16) Added a call to read_experiment_redirect(), otherwise
	some traces read had no original position information. Also
	reformatted to remove windows linefeeds. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(12:13:38) Min template score is now 0.1 (instead of 0.3). 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(12:14:08) Editor group by definition 

	* ChangeLog:

2003-12-01  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/IO.h,
	* src/gap4/IO3.c:
	(15:22:09) Code tidyup to remove unused fortran functions 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl:
	(15:23:08) Improved reading selection from within the editor. Added
	a "select all from right" option (and made it work snappily). 

	* src/gap4/break_contig.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(15:24:13) Fixed a tag corruption bug in disassemble readings
	whereby the annotation freelist could get joined onto the end of a
	contig list when duplicating tags (due to breaking a contig).
	
	Made tag duplication an option. 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl,
	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(15:27:41) Added -no_csel and -csel options to control whether the
	contig selector starts automatically. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(15:27:44) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(15:28:41) Fixed a bug in computation of the number of spanning
	templates; displayed when shutting down the join editor. 

	* src/gap4/preass.c:
	(15:29:06) Replaced used of old fortran functions with C versions. 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(15:29:47) More "select this reading and all to right" code. 

	* src/gap4/template_display.c:
	(15:30:14) Moved update_reading_list function to edInterface.c 

	* src/gap4/edUtils.h:

	status. 

	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(15:31:48) Added get_names_to_right method. 

	* ChangeLog:

	(16:35:01) Fixed a bug in StringMatch() ("search search" command)
	in the positions returned when looking in cutoff data. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(17:28:04) Unfinished new version of shuffle pads - added to make
	compilation work. 

	* src/gap4/Makefile:
	(17:28:54) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/Makefile,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(17:30:19) Disable the new shuffle pads code for now. 

	* src/seq_utils/align.c:
	(17:32:24) Disable balign_sv as it's not included yet (part of the
	experimental shuffle pads code). 

2003-11-26  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/break_contig.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.h,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.tcl,
	* src/gap4/legacy.f,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(15:23:42) Fixed various disassemble readings bugs relating to
	annotations and splitting contigs. Whether to duplicate the
	annotations is now an option (although at present omitted from the
	GUI as it doesn't honour this flag in all cases).
	
	Break contig has also been rewritten to use disassemble readings as
	a basis for its operation.
	
	Finally, the fortran code for both disassemble readings and break
	contig has been ditched. 

	* src/gap4/IO3.c:
	(15:24:23) Fixed a bug in swap_read() (used by disassemble
	readings). It wasn't relinking the "prev" field of notes back to
	the newly renumbered sequence. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db.c:
	(15:24:51) Fixed a bug in merging the db.free_notes fields. 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.tcl:
	(18:01:44) Remove pads from sequence in "find sequence" function
	before doing the search. (It matches padded data fine anyway, so
	this just avoids the user having the depad their query sequence.) 

2003-11-20  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* ChangeLog:
	(15:28:57) First updates from new cvs2changelog tool. 

2003-11-19  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/fake_insert_sizes.tcl:
	(14:30:24) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(14:31:01) Added low_quality solution picking 

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_reverse.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(14:32:13) When setting the template direction we no longer set it
	to ? when there is an inconsistency. This means that the template
	direction will be set to the most well represented direction
	(unless it is 50/50 split in which case it is still ?). 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(14:34:15) When computing the template direction we now set this
	from the first contig in the list rather than the last. The first
	in the list will always be the first contig specified in
	init_template_checks, and so is the 'correct' contig for use within
	prefinish.
	
	The direction is also set to be the most frequent observed
	direction for that template, rather than ? when there is a
	conflict. 

	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(14:34:48) Fixed a bug in TEMP_DIRECTION macro where it returned
	direction -1 for any error, rather than only on a
	TEMP_CONSIST_STRAND error. 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	(15:54:20) Removed debugging 

	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(15:54:34) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl:
	(15:55:07) Load List has an option to specify a list to be a
	"Reading List". This then automatically tags it with SEQID to allow
	hyperlinks to work. 

2003-11-17  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(14:28:50) Minor comment changes 

	* src/gap4/IO.h:
	(14:29:04) Added prototype for IO.h 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	(14:29:32) Include more prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/alter_rel.c,
	* src/gap4/alter_rel.h,
	* src/gap4/alter_rel.tcl,
	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.h:
	(14:31:41) Moved the remove_contig_holes from assemble_direct to
	dis_readings. Rewrote remove contig as a disassemble (for entire
	contig). Major overhaul of disassemble readings. 

	* src/gap4/legacy.f:
	(14:31:59) Removed Fortran version of disassemble readings (now in
	C). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(14:32:37) Added a "clear list" option to the names widget. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.tcl:
	(14:32:56) New disassemble readings interface. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(14:33:50) New disassemble readings interface. 

	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	(14:50:01) Overhaul of split_contig_tags. 

	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c:
	(14:50:45) Added Tcl_ResultResult call to to get_name method. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(14:51:44) Moved checking of file format to after trace widget has
	loaded the file. This removes the need to load the trace twice (the
	first load was in determine_trace_type, now not used). 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(14:52:28) Added ARC= and URL= RAWDATA search methods to fetch
	traces via the ensembl trace archive and via a URL. 

	* src/mutlib/tracealign_interpolate.cpp:
	(14:53:01) Removed a memory read-overflow. 

	* src/seq_utils/align.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align.h:
	(14:54:51) New function calignm(). Like calign(), but the alignment
	matrix (W128) is an argument. The default matrix is now case
	insensitive too. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:56:11) *** empty log message *** 

2003-11-14  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/tracediff/main.cpp:
	(10:25:27) Converted cr/nl to nl.
	
	Fixed a bug in the printing of the tag positions. Positions
	presumably changed from being a single value to a pair - we just
	print the first element now. 

2003-11-13  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/IO2.c:
	(10:11:12) Added code in stikit_ to set r.sense prior to calling
	io_write_seq(). The changes made a while back to io_write_seq() to
	update the in-memory io_length array caused the fortran code to
	break as it uses the sign of the length to set the orientation. 

2003-11-12  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/IO3.c:
	(11:15:42) Protect against the template (subclone_id) in
	get_subclone_info from being zero and causing a crash. Only an
	issue for the old "suggest primers" function and gap2caf. 

2003-11-05  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(14:35:47) Spanning template status is displayed from the join
	editor when the quit button is pressed. 

	* src/gap4/template.h,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(14:35:48) Spanning template status is displayed from the join
	editor when the quit button is pressed. 

	* src/gap4/gap-error.c:
	(17:11:15) Set email address to ask users to report bugs as
	syshelp 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(17:11:38) In the editor reading numbers now have +/- instead of
	<blank>/- to indicate strand. 

2003-11-04  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/dependencies,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl,
	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.h:
	(10:02:01) Added template status analysis into the contig editor
	names display.
	
	The right-click menu now allows a "goto" option to jump to other
	members of that template.
	
	The menu also allows (de)selection of a single reading or
	(de)selection of all readings on that template. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(10:02:40) Added in the colours of template status within the
	editor. 

	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c:
	(10:03:32) Default "chem_as_double" is now 0 (off) 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(10:04:07) Add template-end tolerance code to more locations to
	allow for missing vector at the end of primer-walks. 

2003-10-27  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/contig_id.tcl:
	(14:19:39) Bugfix to selection changes when using a "range"
	contig_id 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.h,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.tcl:
	(14:20:42) Added the ability to search by sequence within the
	readings as well as the consensus. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(14:20:43) Added the ability to search by sequence within the
	readings as well as the consensus. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:20:48) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(14:21:04) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(14:27:23) Fixed out by one error. 

2003-10-24  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/IO.c,
	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	(08:17:18) Improved log file handling to write out the username
	opening the database and a message when the lock file is
	overridden. 

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl:
	(08:18:52) Added a GC_Clamp option to the oligo selection dialogue,
	and remember the users inputs for some other bits. 

	* src/gap4/tagU1.c:
	(08:19:39) Added protection for a defined, but empty, GTAGDB
	environment variable. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/qual.h,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.c,
	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(08:21:15) Extended the database_info (and similar) callback
	functions to take new job types for insertion and deletion into
	sequences. This is currently only used by the new experimental
	shuffle pads option. 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(08:23:03) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(08:24:07) Protect against the base spacing being listed as a
	negative number in the ABI file. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c:
	(08:24:29) Added a -fofn option 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(08:24:57) More error checking on writing compressed files. 

	* src/mk/alpha.mk:
	(08:25:28) Removed -rpath support as it causes more problems than
	it cures. 

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	(08:26:33) Added a baseline (-b) option to remove background. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(16:21:48) The contig identifier box and the 'value' component in
	the editor search boxes are now automatically selected and focused,
	meaning that users can simply type over the previous value. 

	* src/gap4/contig_id.tcl:
	(16:21:49) The contig identifier box and the 'value' component in
	the editor search boxes are now automatically selected and focused,
	meaning that users can simply type over the previous value. 

2003-10-23  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c,
	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c,
	* src/gap4/hash_lib.h:
	(17:05:27) Fixed a bug in Find Internal Joins where it failed to
	spot some matches. 

2003-10-22  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(09:20:53) Added hyperlinks to the disassemble and 'set active
	list' lists created from the editor. 

2003-10-16  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/dependencies,
	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl,
	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.h,
	* src/prefinish/sanger_names.tcl:
	(09:21:18) Added an svec_as_cvec flag to allow SVEC tags to be
	treated as the clone end. This is useful for finishing EST
	sequences with one EST per contig. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.h:
	(09:21:18) branches:  1.2.2; Added an svec_as_cvec flag to allow
	SVEC tags to be treated as the clone end. This is useful for
	finishing EST sequences with one EST per contig. 

2003-10-02  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c:
	(09:15:55) Contig holes left after a disassembly are now stripped
	out, fixing db inconsistencies. This function will also be useful
	for the disassemble readings rewrite. 

2003-10-01  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/fake_insert_sizes.tcl,
	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA,
	* src/prefinish/svec2cvec.tcl:
	(13:47:31) New scripts for interfacing with the chickenEST project
	and the new finish_me3 perl script. 

	* src/g/freetree.c:
	(13:52:13) When we have a tr->largest block long enough to hold the
	requested length, we were returning NULL (due to broken code
	ordering) instead of returning the block. This causes the database
	to unnecessarily grow! 

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(13:53:37) Ensure that io_length() memory cache is kept up to date
	when io_write_seq modifies it. 

	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c:
	(13:57:23) Set upper limit on the size of set_band_blocks to 5000
	so that really long alignments do not consume too much memory. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(13:59:27) *** empty log message *** 

2003-09-04  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	(08:51:26) When searching for a solution on the bottom strand, set
	the position to solve as the right hand end of this problem.
	Likewise for the top strand (which is true by default). 

2003-09-02  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	(13:26:24) Fixed default value of pwalk_nsolutions from 400 (a cut
	and paste error) to 1. Luckily finish.tcl specified this
	explicitly. 

2003-08-05  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	(16:45:24)	We now search for fake templates (func
	skip_fake_templates) based	 on looking for sequences without
	trace files. This is in addition       to the usual skip_templates
	file and provides an easy automatic	    way of filtering out
	imported consensus sequences and the like. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	(16:46:16) 1.22 

2003-07-22  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	(15:49:00) Added a -version option to the finish_sanger program.
	Added a "version" method to the finish object. 

2003-07-18  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger:
	(10:38:22) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	(10:38:49) Sanger specific finish.tcl config with multiple
	configurations in a single file, selectable via command line
	arguments. 

2003-07-17  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c,
	* src/gap4/extract.c:
	(09:19:17) Using Extract Readings in 'directed assembly, anchor
	start' was horribly slow due to the next_AP_left function. This has
	now been removed and replaced by tweaks in the sort readings code.
	Also fixed a bug whereby readings with SL/SR visible in the used
	data would cause the sequence to be clipped on reentering using
	assemble_direct.c. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(09:21:22) v1.20
	
	Minor penalty to experiments where we were asked for N members of a
	group but we only found <N members. Eg picking 2 templates when we
	wanted 4 for the primer-walk. 

	* src/prefinish/dependencies,
	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	(13:55:59) Added -reseq_nsolutions, -long_nsolutions and
	-pwalk_nsolutions. These control how many solutions (not groups)
	are applied to each problem. By default we now pick 4 resequences
	and longreads and 1 primer walk (with 4 templates still). 

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.c:
	(13:55:59) branches:  1.2.2; Added -reseq_nsolutions,
	-long_nsolutions and -pwalk_nsolutions. These control how many
	solutions (not groups) are applied to each problem. By default we
	now pick 4 resequences and longreads and 1 primer walk (with 4
	templates still). 

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_reverse.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c,
	* src/prefinish/help,
	* src/prefinish/param_costs.itcl:
	(13:56:00) Added -reseq_nsolutions, -long_nsolutions and
	-pwalk_nsolutions. These control how many solutions (not groups)
	are applied to each problem. By default we now pick 4 resequences
	and longreads and 1 primer walk (with 4 templates still). 

2003-07-14  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* lib/Makefile:
	(15:58:03) Fix make distrib target 

	* src/abi/Makefile:
	(15:58:54) Added program getABIfloat. 

	* src/abi/Attic/getABIfloat.c:
	(15:58:55) Added program getABIfloat. 

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(15:59:31) When converting very old gap4 database, backup to
	version ~ instead of B as version B is locally used for something
	else. 

	* src/prefinish/Makefile,
	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(16:01:12) Added various POLY_? filters to the base classification
	system. 

	* src/gap4/restriction_enzymes.c:
	(16:02:38) The gap4 restriction enzyme map now shows fragment sizes
	computed from the unpadded consensus. This required adding a padded
	and unpadded copy of the data to the renz structures. 

	* src/seq_utils/renz_utils.c,
	* src/seq_utils/renz_utils.h:

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	(16:04:04) Stops can now automatically iterate through all the
	files in a directory. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c:
	(16:04:59) By default plot traces as if TRACE is a signed value.
	This is controllable by an argument to trade_draw2 (and currently
	set to 1).

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(11:14:14) Put back the Staden Makefile as I accidently overwrote
	this with the autoconf generate one. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile:
	(11:14:18) *** empty log message *** 

2003-07-07  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c,
	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.h:
	(11:20:37) Confidence values (PCON 1) are now loaded from ABI
	files. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am:
	(11:24:46) Added automake/autoconf/libtool files to CVS tree. Not
	all of these are 'source' files as some are generated by others,
	but for ease of compilation the output from these tools is
	distribute too, meaning that only './configure' needs to be run.

2003-07-02  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(10:41:57) Set -tearoffs 0 on cascading edit tag and delete tag
	menus. 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl:
	(10:42:58) New function with a binding "Edit contig at tag pos"
	menu. Right clicking in a tag in the contig selector now allows the
	editor to be brought up at that position. 

	* src/gap4/edMutations.c:
	(10:43:27) Remove buffer overflow. (Index using 1-N on an array
	alloc of N.) 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(10:44:20) Scrolling down sequences when the Y-depth was too high
	would position the cursor on a sequence underneath the consensus
	line without Y scrolling the editor window properly. 

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c:
	(10:44:44) Searching could miss hits (eg tags, and probably many
	other things) when Group Readings by Templates was enabled. 

	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(10:46:24) check_template_position() was resetting the consistency
	value to zero, which overwrites the CONSIST_STRAND flags. Deleted
	this.
	
	Also added a new function check_template_length() to estimate
	template size for templates spanning contigs. Answer is put in
	template_c->computed_length and the flags are updated accordingly
	with DIST error if needed. 

	* src/gap4/tman_diff.c:
	(10:46:49) When a trace isn't there to diff against, we now create
	a blank Read instead of returning NULL. This fixes a bug of missing
	difference traces causing the mutation report to fail. 

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(10:47:06) Corrected mutation report generation when the
	mini-traces are shown. 

	* src/mutlib/caller_base.cpp:
	(10:50:26) STILL BUGGED. Not sure what the correct answer is (not
	my code), but commented out an offending line to prevent a crash:
	
	<     m_nPosition[2] = nPos; --- >     // m_nPosition[2] = nPos;
	jkb 25/06/2003. What should this be?
	
	m_nPosition is only 2 large ([0] and [1]). 

	* src/mutlib/sp_alignment.cpp:
	(10:51:18) Use (double,double) prototype for pow() as the previous
	use caused a problem when using cxx -strictansi on Tru64. 

	* src/prefinish/add_stops.tcl:
	(10:51:37) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/qclip/qclip.c:
	(10:52:02) Increase default max right clip from 10000 to 10000000. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(10:53:10) When checking templates we now check all other contigs
	sharing templates with the contig we are interested in. This means
	that the TEMP_FLAG_SPANNING checks elsewhere work and it also
	allows for the new template.c code to identify spanning templates
	with bad lengths. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(10:53:41) Better error handling if png initialisation fails. 

	* src/tk_utils/Attic/png.h:
	(10:54:27) We have a hard-coded library version install, so this is
	the header file for the appropriate version to prevent any system
	headers being picked up instead.

	(15:35:19) *** empty log message *** 

	* doc/manual/clip-t.texi,
	* doc/manual/contig_editor-t.texi:
	(15:35:42) Document N-clip and edit/delete tag cascading menus. 

	* lib/Makefile:
	(15:35:49) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/Makefile:
	(15:35:54) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/gap.tcl,
	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(15:36:26) Put back the Any-Configure binding as it appears to be
	necessary on neons. 

	* src/mk/alpha.mk,
	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(15:36:47) Use gcc-3.2 as gcc-3.0.3 generates buggy code on the
	alpha with -O2. 

	* src/prefinish/Makefile:
	(15:36:53) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/spin2_emboss/Makefile:
	(15:37:00) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/spin_emboss/Makefile:
	(15:37:05) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	(15:37:30) Tweaked the default parameters to use a longer window
	length and fixed a bug in identifying stops to skip. 

	* src/prefinish/add_stops.tcl:
	(15:38:00) New script to parse 'stops' program output and add STOP
	tags. 

	* Makefile:
	(15:44:29) Deleted the out dated distviewer* targets. 

2003-06-20  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/clip.h:
	(13:10:57) Added a clip sequence by %age of non-ACGT (labelled
	N-clip). This solves a phrap alignment bug. 

	* src/prefinish/dust.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	(14:08:59) Tweaks the dust window from 64 to 48 and adjusted the
	dust score accordingly. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(14:09:40) When generating consensus for primer3 we now check the
	dust-filtering so as not to pick primers from low sequence. These
	were filtered out later, but it's faster to prefilter. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.h:
	(14:10:05) Added code to keep track of when a 'virtual sequence'
	overlaps another virtual sequence. If more than 2/3rds of it does
	then we start applying a penalty. This is designed to filter out
	the cases where repeating a primer-walk just a few bases further
	along solves a few more bases. 

2003-06-19  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/clip.c,
	* src/gap4/clip.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(10:27:42) Added a clip sequence by %age of non-ACGT (labelled
	N-clip). This solves a phrap alignment bug. 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(10:27:55) *** empty log message *** 

	* ChangeLog:
	(10:28:14) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	(10:29:27) Fixed a bug with loading tag macros from .gaprc. 

	* src/stops/Makefile,
	* src/stops/stops.c:
	(10:36:40) First version of the 'stop' detector. At present it just
	outputs the info to stdout. 

	* src/Makefile:
	(10:36:43) *** empty log message *** 

2003-06-16  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(08:44:36) Added 'break' to F10 binding so that the global keyboard
	menu traversal bindings do trigger. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(14:32:54) Replace the trace-flash window to cover the whole height
	of the trace instead of +40 onwards. (+40 was inappropriate after
	we moved the base calls from the top to the bottom of the trace.) 

2003-06-11  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	* src/gap4/tag_checklist.tcl:
	(13:26:08) removing debugging output 

	* ChangeLog:
	(13:27:52) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU1.c,
	* src/gap4/tagUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(13:28:08) The Edit Tag and Delete tag editor commands are now
	cascading menus containing the list of all tags underneath the
	editing cursor. These lists are updated even if the menus have been
	torn off and after undo, etc. 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(13:28:14) The Edit Tag and Delete tag editor commands are now
	cascading menus containing the list of all tags underneath the
	editing cursor. These lists are updated even if the menus have been
	torn off and after undo, etc.

2005-11-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(14:12:58) Removed dead shuffle pads code, but reenabled the
	removal of columns of pads in the contig editor by changing the old
	editor shuffle_pads command to be strip_pads. 

	* src/gap4/edCommands.c,
	* src/gap4/edCommands.h,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(14:12:59) Removed dead shuffle pads code, but reenabled the
	removal of columns of pads in the contig editor by changing the old
	editor shuffle_pads command to be strip_pads. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(14:13:34) Fixed crash when the number of snps found was zero. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c:
	(14:14:16) Used open_trace_mfile instead of open_trace_file to
	avoid the need for temporary files and hence speeds this up. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(14:23:23) fwrite_reading now frees the temporary mFILE it created. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.h,
	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(14:45:41) Added private_data and private_size to the Read
	structure & populate from SCF. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(14:48:51) mfreopen_compressed no longer closes the original FILE*.
	This makes it backwards compatible once more with the original
	version and also cures a bug whereby the old file pointer was often
	left open, leading to running out of file descriptors. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(15:05:51) Fixed uninitialised check when filename was specified
	but not found in mfload. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/read_alloc.c:
	(15:17:01) Added private_data to read struct 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(15:19:39) Added strip pads (aka pad column removal) defaults 

2005-11-10  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_extract.c:
	(11:32:06) Now returns an error code (to the calling process) if it
	failed to extract a sequence. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c:
	(11:33:07) Fixed problem in hashquery when searching for something
	that has a hash key not present (ie empty hash bucket). 

2005-10-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(15:46:45) Fixed hang in mfload when given zero length files. 

2005-10-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h,
	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c,
	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.h,
	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.tcl:
	(08:19:41) Made the band size a configurable parameter.
	
	Also fixed a bug with tag corruptions on both complemented readings
	and on the consensus. 

	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(08:20:26) NDEBUG checks 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(08:20:56) Added band size parameter for shuffle pads. Removed old
	contig editor shuffle pads settings. 

2005-10-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/bootstrap:
	(09:15:23) Removed more auto-generated files. 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am:
	(09:16:43) Further removal of libtool specific bits (AC_CHECK_LIB). 

	* src/haplo/haplo_snps.c:
	(16:02:59) Improved how the SNP base calls are computed for each
	template. We now compute a simple consensus for the template rather
	than just throwing out that SNP position on a template if there are
	mismatches within the template. The template consensus has to be
	above the minimum quality threshold to be accepted. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(16:03:35) Fixed bug with IOLIB_ZTR vs IOLIB_SFF macro. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/bootstrap,
	* src/io_lib/configure.in,
	* src/io_lib/read/Read.h,
	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(16:04:48) Replaced automake's generated config.h file
	io_lib_config and allow for it to be installed with "make install". 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am:
	(16:05:19) Added append_sff to the targets. 

	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(16:05:42) Disabled asserts 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(16:06:25) Fixed bug in mfgetc when dealing with 8-bit data. It
	always now returns unsigned values except when EOF 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:07:20) Updated TAR magic number to be just the 5 first bytes as
	the 6th differs between systems (space vs nul). 

2005-10-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/notes.c,
	* src/gap4/notes.h:
	(13:27:37) Added a find_note function to check if a specific note
	type is attached to a given reading. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_snps.c:
	(13:29:10) Now skips reference sequences (note "REFS") from SNP
	detection. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.h,
	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(13:30:30) Made the arbitrary "0.6" figure in the calc_edge_score
	function a configurable parameter (-correlation_offset), all the
	way back to the GUI. The default is now 0.9 too which works much
	better when >2 haplotypes are present. 

	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.c:
	(13:31:22) Split the read functions into read & decode functions so
	that we can unpack SFF structs from other sources. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/append_sff.c:
	(13:31:58) Added an append_sff.c program, to combine multiple SFF
	archives into a single archive. 

2005-10-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(16:41:44) Modified to check RAWDATA search path when loading
	traces. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_sff.c:
	(16:42:58) Major overhaul to not load the entire SFF file into
	memory. It also handles copying the SFF file to a new file and
	adding an index to an SFF archive that already has an index. 

	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.c,
	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.h:
	(16:44:31) Restructured read functions to load & decode functions
	so we can decode SFF data blocks obtained via other means (eg as
	used in the indexing code). 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:45:42) Added SFF "sorted index" code, based on 454's getsff.c
	implementation. Also restructured the SFF querying code a bit so
	that it caches this data. 

2005-10-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES:
	(16:07:36) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(16:08:32) Renamed _MSV_VER to _WIN32 so that the binary/ascii
	conversions for experiment file IO works once more under Windows. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_sff.c:
	(16:09:08) Added hash_sff program. This adds a .hsh format index to
	the SFF container. 

	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.c,
	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.h:
	(16:10:10) A total rewrite of the SFF code due to the recent
	changes in file format. This code handles access of a *single* SFF
	entry. The code to manipulate multi-file SFF (ie the container) is
	in open_trace_file.c. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	(16:11:33) HashFileSave now returns the length of the saved hash.
	
	HashFileFopen now sets afp by default to be the same as hfp. Extra
	checking has been added when closing these file pointers to ensure
	we don't close twice if they point to the same FILE*. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(16:12:58) Added an mfascii() function. This allows for changing
	from binary to ascii after a file has been opened. It should be
	called in place of where the windows-specific _set_mode() function
	would be used.
	
	There is currently no analagous ascii-to-binary conversion, but I
	have not yet found a need for it either. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mach-io.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mach-io.h:
	(16:13:29) Added [bl]e_{read,write}_int_8 functions for use with
	8-byte data types found in SFF. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(16:14:55) Added a SFF= format for the RAWDATA search path. This
	handles the SFF container in much the same way that TAR= and HASH=
	works.
	
	Also for all three of these types you can now do archive/entry
	instead. Eg "extract_seq traces.tar/xyz.ztr" will work and it'll
	even look for traces.tar in RAWDATA if required. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/os.h:
	(16:15:19) Added a uint1 typedef for completeness. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/read/Makefile.am:
	(16:16:06) Makefile support for new sff.c files. 

	* src/io_lib/dependencies:
	(16:16:23) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(16:16:43) Updated to version 1.9.1.

	(11:34:31) Fixed = vs == bug so that char_set was always treated as
	DNA. 

	* src/primer3/src/primer3_lib.c:
	(11:35:04) Tidied up prototype of find_stop_codon to prevent icc
	warnings. 

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(15:59:25) Use 'orig_format' instead of 'format' method for saving
	a trace when exiting trev or using next/prev. This fixes a bug
	where interactive clipping (among other places) would create ztr
	files after clipping.

	* demo/gap4/DEMO.0,
	* demo/gap4/DEMO.0.aux,
	* demo/gap4/traces.tar,
	* demo/gap4/Attic/traces.tar.hash:
	(13:24:44) Appended the traces.tar.hash to traces.tar (using the
	new hash format) and updated the search path in the gapdb
	accordingly. 

	* Makefile:

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	(16:04:06) Fixed the hash file saving and loading so that it works
	on all platforms instead of just x86 linux. There were bugs in
	assuming the size of structures. The assumptions are still there in
	that I assume they pad the same internally (for ease of coding - we
	can change it when we finally see a system which operates
	differently), but the final "boundary" padding has been resolved. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(16:20:45) Removed load of /tmp/nuc_matrix. The default one in
	tables will have already been loaded and is sufficient (I hope...
	the one in /tmp long bit the dust!) 

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl:
	(16:49:32) Added help link

	compiled by default) for conversion of those REALLY old databases. 

	* src/convert/gapDB.c:

2005-09-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(10:43:49) Fixed a bug in Report Mutations causing potential
	crashes and/or a lack of images in the HTML report.

	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(10:47:30) Added a minimum quality slider to the Report Mutations
	"by differences" mode. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(10:48:21) Removed crash when inputting data that does not have
	trace points. Allows importing mixed trace + consensus/reference
	sequence files. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(10:49:09) Fixed trace_pyroalign(). 

2005-09-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c:
	(15:54:28) Fixed the computation of the re-padded coordinates for
	alignments made when the first sequence were complemented.
	Previously this could overstep an array bounding and hence gaves
	erratic positions. (Rarely seen, but easier to trigger using probe
	with single sequence.) 

2005-09-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(13:22:07) Changed the default trace type from " " to "ANY" for
	readings with no trace type record. 

2005-09-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(14:33:11) Fixed displaying and searching of edits when they happen
	to be the last base in a sequence. 

2005-09-19  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(13:58:02) Fixed a file descriptor (and some memory) leak in
	freopen_compressed. (Bug ID #1289095) 

2005-09-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.c,
	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(11:29:06) Don't try to compress SAMP chunks with meta-data PYRW as
	the raw pyrosequencing data from 454 doesn't compress. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_tar.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/Hash_File_Format,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	(11:30:56) Changed the HashFile format slightly. It's now format
	1.00.
	
	The key difference is that it has a file footer pointing back to
	the hashfile header (so the hashfile can be appended to an archive)
	and it also has an offset in the header to apply to all seeks
	within the archive itself, so it can be prepending to an archive
	that's already been indexed without breaking the offsets.
	
	Extended the hash_tar program to allow control over these header
	options.

	in the HashFile structure. It also now checks for the correct size
	of file to load. 

	* src/io_lib/sff/sff.c,

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.h:
	(10:55:24) More fixes to shuffle pads. Removed memory leaks. Added
	code to keep tag positions up to date. Hopefully this now means all
	the known bugs and missing features have been dealt with. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.h:
	(10:55:57) Added header file for shuffle pads prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/edCommands.c:
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_mito:
	(14:30:19) Removed Shuffle Pads from the editor menus. However I
	also put back the old shuffle pads code (which worked better) so
	that the gaprc file can be edited to reenable it still if desired.
	It's been removed from the menu due to being superseded by the new
	re-alignment method. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(14:31:09) Fixed search by sequence to reenable the 'where' clause
	(sequence or consensus). This was accidentally disabled. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(14:31:30) Removed debugging output. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:32:30) Added shuffle pads tcl/tk dialogue. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile,

	* src/io_lib/options.mk:
	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c,
	* src/io_lib/read/Read.h,
	* src/io_lib/utils/traceType.c:
	(15:15:25) Added draft SFF format support. I need to verify if the
	example data files I tested this with are correct or if the SFF
	draft spec is correct (as they differ marginally in places). Hence
	this format may change soon. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(15:16:31) Added (commented out) code for extra debugging. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile:
	(15:16:48) Added hash_extract to the Makefile. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(15:17:43) Improved pyrosequencing style trace support by
	auto-scaling. 

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(15:18:17) Changed the default scale when displaying pyrosequencing
	traces. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(16:02:52) Fixed a bug where sequences originally ending in pads
	but not after realignment would cause a fatal error to be reported
	(wrongly) due to apparently having data missing after the
	alignment. 

2005-08-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edMutations.c:
	(09:28:54) Fixed crashes with using Report Mutations in HTML mode
	and finding mutations by base call differences rather than tags. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.h:
	(13:38:30) Further work on shuffle pads. This latest code is
	substantially faster than before and also seems to work well except
	for currently not updating consensus annotations. 

2005-07-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(15:36:17) Fixed bug with not updating the in-memory
	io_relpos/io_length arrays. Removed debugging & general tidy up.
	Changed gap penalties from -8 to -9. 

2005-07-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/Makefile:
	(15:46:18) Added back the shuffle_pads code to the compilation. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(15:47:45) Reenabled the shuffle_pads command. 

	* src/gap4/shuffle_pads.c:
	(15:49:41) Removed the old shuffle pads by align_sv code, but kept
	the interface to Rodger's malign code.
	
	Sped up the editing section by keeping the malign data up to date
	as we go instead of rebuilding after each pad. This has a massive
	speed improvement.
	
	Added code to write the new alignments back to the database. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(15:50:51) Fixed arg structure used (flukily worked before). 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(15:52:07) Unset compression_used when opening uncompressed files
	instead of leaving as the last value. 

	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.c:
	* src/seq_utils/align_lib.h:
	(15:57:12) Added destroy_malign_counts, malign_insert_scores and
	malign_recalc_scores functions. The latter of these allow for
	updating of the malign scores and consensus elements after a
	contigl list has been updated. Used as a fast alternative to
	rebuilding from scratch.
	
	Removed unused msegs element of MALIGN struct.
	
	Allow for gap_open and gap_extend to be passed in when building an
	MALIGN. These are then used instead of the previous hardwired
	settings.
	
	Fixed a bug in affine_malign where the first rows of the F and G
	matrix were undefined meaning that the computation of G (gap in Y)
	used uninitialised data. This was the cause of sometimes giving
	daft alignments. The same bug probably exists in all the other
	alignment functions here, but has not been checked or fixed. 

2005-07-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(15:16:58) Removed file descriptor 'leak' in write_reading(). 

2005-07-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/pregap4/modules/interactive_clip.p4m:
	(08:33:57) Fix for when the file of filenames contains space, so
	pregap4 works in the default windows install path. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(11:34:57) Fixed a bug in filter_tags. It now protects against
	MUT/HET tags being outside of the MCOV tag range. 

	* Version:
	(13:51:17) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(13:52:37) Updated to use tcl/tk 8.4.11 and a more official
	itcl/itk release (instead of a dated CVS checkout). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(13:53:08) Fixed MS Windows mouse wheel support 

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(13:53:45) Commenting only 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(13:54:54) mfopen now honours binary verses ascii differences (and
	so updated Read.c calls accordingly) so that Windows works better.
	
	Also improved append mode of opening. 

	* src/spin_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl:
	(13:56:02) Added an update call to resizebook; fixes dialogue size
	issues on Windows.
	
	Moved EMBOSS_DATA \ for / fix so that it doesn't error when
	EMBOSS_DATA is undefined. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(13:57:16) Use XGetImage with plane_mask as 1 (instead of
	AllPlanes) when on Windows. It gives b/w images, but prevents error
	dialogues commenting on "not implemented". 

	* src/windows/include/unistd.h:
	(13:58:03) Newer mingw seems better behaved, so the definitions of
	access *_OK macros are not protected around #ifdefs.

	* Makefile:
	(08:33:12) Added LICENCE.rtf to distwindows 

	* src/Makefile:
	(08:38:54) distwindows updates 

	* src/copy_reads/Makefile,
	* src/gap4/Makefile:
	* src/pregap4/Makefile,
	* src/spin/Makefile,
	* src/spin2/Makefile,
	* src/trev/Makefile:
	(08:40:19) Minor updates so that "make install" works on windows;
	basically allow for errors to be ignored. 

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr.c:
	(08:41:16) Removed the warning for unknown chunk types. It now just
	silently stores them in memory. 

	* src/Misc/getfile.c:
	(11:20:08) Fixed expandpath() to not change //foo/bar to /foo/bar
	so that UNC pathnames work under Windows. 

2005-07-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/spin_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl:
	(11:13:41) Replace \ with / in EMBOSS_DATA path so that the
	environment set up by the default installation of EMBOSSwin works
	with Spin. 

2005-07-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(14:01:50) Fixed divide-by-zero buf when calling mfread for zero
	bytes. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(16:07:38) Fixed IO_LIB_* macros to be IOLIB_* macros. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db_main.c:
	(16:13:28) Added optarg/optind DLL waffle for windows. 

2005-07-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/g-db.c:
	(16:01:49) Put _WIN32 checks around the fcntl call in
	g_shutdown_database_.

	(09:09:50) Removed as these have now been collapsed into the
	read/Makefile.am. 

	* src/io_lib/README:
	(09:10:19) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/include/Attic/os.h:
	(09:11:21) Removed the mkdir macro as it seems the current mingw
	has proper support for this. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Makefile.am:
	(09:12:18) Subsumed the other */Makefile.am files. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_tar.c:
	(09:12:48) On Windows, set stdout to be _O_BINARY. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(09:13:22) Fixed the _O_BINARY setting code on windows to check for
	fp being valid and to use the mf->fp instead of fp. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(09:15:30) Added checks for HAVE_SYS_WAIT_H for Windows handling. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(09:20:04) Moved HAVE_ZLIB_H from compress.c and put in os.h (when
	autoconf is not in use). 

	* src/io_lib/include/Attic/os.h:
	(09:20:05) Moved HAVE_ZLIB_H from compress.c and put in os.h (when
	autoconf is not in use). 

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.c:
	(09:21:45) Changed bucket_pos from int64_t to int32_t (as was
	intended) so it works on windows correctly. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c:
	(09:22:50) Added more _O_BINARY checks for windows. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(09:23:28) Added error checking in open_trace_file(). 

	* src/io_lib/bootstrap:
	(10:28:38) Added to simplify initialisation of the autoconf system. 

	* src/io_lib/include/Attic/os.h,
	* src/io_lib/utils/os.h:
	(10:34:54) Moved os.h from include to utils. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am:

	* src/io_lib/Attic/mkinstalldirs,
	* src/io_lib/Attic/stamp-h.in:
	(10:55:09) Removed more auto-generated files from CVS tree. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.h:
	(14:28:29) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/init_exp/init_exp.c:
	(15:46:19) Switched to use exp_print_mfile and mFILE. 

	* src/text_utils/Makefile,
	* src/tk_utils/Makefile:
	(15:57:33) Made the .links "ln" commands not be fatal when erroring
	(when for example the files already exist). 

2005-07-04  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(09:21:27) Switch to using a different zlib/png sub-makefile for
	solaris9. 

	* src/gap4/IO2.c:
	(09:23:11) Added include to get log_file prototype. 

	* src/eba/qual.c:
	* src/gap4/consen.c,
	* src/gap4/extract.c,
	* src/gap4/seqInfo.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	(09:24:31) Updates to use the new mFILE based I/O of io_lib. 

	* src/io_lib/README:
	(09:24:49) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/CHANGES:
	(09:24:50) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/read/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/scf/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/utils/Makefile.am:
	(09:25:34) Adjusted EXTRA_DIST definitions to only include files we
	still appear to have! 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.in:
	* src/io_lib/read/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/scf/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/utils/Makefile.in:
	* src/io_lib/config.h.in,
	* src/io_lib/configure:
	(09:26:33) (rebuilt) 

	* src/io_lib/configure.in:
	(09:27:05) Updated to use newer AC_INIT syntax. 

	* src/io_lib/read/Read.c:
	(10:21:50) Made the default output format ZTR. Do not compress
	output (via gzip for example) if ZTR2 or ZTR3 is used. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	(10:25:19) If HAVE_ZLIB isn't defined then the memgzip/memgunzip
	functions are now also not built (and hence removes compilation
	errors).
	
	The pipe2 function now uses waitpid to avoid zombies. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	(10:29:41) Added mfrecreate() function to	change an existing
	mFILE to point to new data. Better handling of append mode in
	mfreopen. Fixed mf->fname such that it's now always a pointer to
	malloced data. Added mfdestroy to deallocate memory, but without
	flushing or closing file descriptors. Changed mfflush to write data
	regardless of whether it's stdin/stdout. This means that
	mfflush+mfdestroy can be used to close	 an mFILE without closing
	the underlying FILE pointer used. Added mftruncate. Rewrote mfread
	to do a single memcpy instead of   looped  memcpys. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(10:30:24) The .dir target is now hopefully more silent in
	operation. 

	* src/mk/solaris.cc.mk,
	* src/mk/solaris.gcc.mk:
	(10:31:14) Disabled BIOLIMS support by default. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.h,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c:
	(10:32:33) Added a -yticks option to draw lines at set intervals
	along the Y axis (ie horizontal lines). 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(10:33:46) Improved pyrosequencing re-alignment code. Use new mFILE
	io_lib structs.

	* src/abi/Attic/getABIhex.c,
	* src/abi/Attic/getABIraw.c,
	* src/abi/Attic/getABIstring.c:
	(09:05:51) Removed junk that's either now irrelevant or replaced by
	getABIfield. 

	* src/abi/abiIO.c,
	* src/abi/abiIO.h:
	(09:08:18) Moved portions from getABIfield.c into this new file so
	that other tools can link with it. Ultimately this'll replace
	seqIOABI.c in io_lib. 

	* src/abi/Makefile,
	* src/abi/getABISampleName.c,
	* src/abi/getABIcomment.c,
	* src/abi/getABIdate.c,
	* src/abi/getABIfield.c:
	(09:09:04) Updated getABIfield to use abiIO.c (split off from it)
	and totally rewrote getABISampleName, getABIcomment and getABIdate
	to also use abiIO.c. 

2005-06-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* demo/gap4/DEMO.0:
	* demo/gap4/DEMO.0.aux:
	(09:36:56) Updated to use HASH= instead of TAR= for rawdata. 

	* demo/gap4/traces.tar.hash,
	* demo/gap4/Attic/traces.tar.index:
	(09:40:36) Replaced the .index with a .hash file (created via
	hash_tar). 

	* src/get_scf_field/get_scf_field.c:
	(13:23:11) Updated to use mFILE and the new io_lib.

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(13:33:33) Version 1.9.0-test
	
	- Significant speed ups, particularly when dealing with reading  
	gzipped files or when extracting data from tar files.
	
	- New external functions for faster access via mFILE (memory-file) 
	 structs. These mimic the fread/fwrite calls, but with
	mfread/mfwrite	 etc.
	
	- Some functions previously available in external scope, but not  
	defined in header files, have now been made internal only  
	("static"). Please contact me if you were using these and have a  
	burning need for them to remain external.
	
	- Numerous minor tweaks and updates to fix compiler warnings on
	more   stricter modes of the Intel C Compiler.
	
	- Preliminary support for storing pyrosequencing style traces. This
	  has been modeled on the flowgram data from 454, but should be  
	applicable to other platforms. ZTR has been updated to incorporate 
	 this too.
	
	  The Read structure also has flow, flow_order, nflows and flow_raw
	  elements too. Code to convert these into the more usual
	traceA/C/G/T   arrays exists currently as part of Trev (in tk_utils
	in the Staden	Package), but this may move into io_lib for the
	next official	release.
	
	- New hash_tar and hash_extract programs. These replace the
	index_tar   program for rast random access. For RAWDATA include
	"HASH=hashfile"   as an element to get io_lib to use the archive
	hash. It's possible   to create hash files of most archive formats
	as the hash itself   contains the offset and size of each item in
	the archive. This means   that extracting an item does not need to
	know the format of the	 original archive.
	
	  Some benchmarks show that on ext3 it's actually faster to extract
	  files from the hash than directly via the directory. This was  
	testing with ~200,000 files, whereupon directory lookups become  
	slow. I'd imagine ResierFS or similar to be faster.
	
	- Added an XRLE encoding for ZTR. This is similar to the existing
	RLE   mechanism but it copes with run length encoding of items
	larger than   a single byte. It's current use is for storing the
	4-base repeating   flow order in 454 data.
	
	- Potential incompatibilities:
	
	  - The Exp_info structure now has an "mFILE *fp" member instead of
	    "FILE *fp".
	
	  - As mentioned above, some functions are no longer external.
	These	  include many ctf functions, ztr_(de)compress,    
	ztr_chunk_(read/write), be_read_*, be_write_*,
	
	  - The default search order for RAWDATA is that the current
	directory     is searched after the rest of rawdata instead of
	before.
	
	  - Removed support for the old unix "pack" program as a
	compression	tool. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/vlen.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/vlen.h:
	(13:35:42) vlen/vflen functions to estimate the maximum data size
	written out by a printf style function. This is used by the new
	mFILE functions. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.c,
	* src/io_lib/utils/mFILE.h:
	* src/io_lib/utils/stdio_hack.h:
	(13:39:13) mFILE struct support. This is basically a set of
	functions to similulate stdio file support on a block of memory
	instead of a file, for purposes of speed and to avoid the need of
	writing data out to a file only to be opened and read back in again
	(which happened a lot before).
	
	stdio_hack.h is, like it says, a hacky bunch of #defines to turn
	stdio functions and io_lib functions into their mFILE equivalents.
	It is used internally to convert old code (eg ABI file reading) to
	use mFILE structures, but can also be used by the brave to update
	their own code. Use with extreme caution.

	* src/haplo/haplo_cons.c:
	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(13:46:39) Handle asking for the consensus from zero templates. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c:
	(13:48:20) Moved the generation of "ungrouped" templates from C to
	Tcl (haplo::find_ungrouped). The reason is that in C we just have a
	list of templates covering the candidate SNPs and not a list of all
	the templates in the contig. 

	* src/gap4/clip.c:
	(15:53:41) Removed a 1-byte buffer overrun in the quality clip
	contig ends function. 

2005-06-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c:
	(13:20:09) The splitting code now returns a list of the templates
	should didn't make it into any group. This is now used by the tcl
	split-to-contigs code to produce a better "fake" sequence that
	includes these ungrouped readings.
	
	Also added a save consensus option to the right-click set menus.
	This saves the consensus of one or more groups and so removes the
	*requirement* to split contigs if you wish to just obtain the
	consensus. The ungrouped readings can optionally be included in
	that consensus output too. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(14:26:25) Added an option to save a fofn for reading names in a
	set. 

	* tables/haplorc:
	(14:27:18) Added fofn/consensus saving defs. 

2005-06-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/hash_table.h:
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_extract.c,
	* src/io_lib/progs/hash_tar.c:
	(08:37:23) Added some simple hash table functions. Layered on top
	of these are HashFiles, which allow hash table indexing of files to
	be stored on disk. hash_tar and hash_extract test programs
	illustrate its use on tar files, much like index_tar does. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	(08:38:22) Added support for integrating the new hashfile code via
	a "HASH=hashfile" RAWDATA setting. 

2005-05-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/g-io.c:
	(11:19:29) Fixed 32-bit file reading code for big-endian machines
	(eg Sun SPARC).

	* NEWS:
	(09:28:28) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/IO2.c,
	* src/gap4/io-reg.c,
	* src/tk_utils/text_output.c:
	(09:29:49) Improved the logging of register and deregister
	functions in Gap4. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db.c,
	* src/gap4/copy_db.h,
	* src/gap4/copy_db_main.c:
	(09:31:01) Added an option to omit tags when copying the database.
	This is just a simple hack to "fix" databases when the only thing
	broken is horrendously messed up tags. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	(09:32:52) Better error checking in code used by disassemble
	readings and break contig. I've seen a couple tag corruptions
	recently that I've been unable to pin down - maybe this'll spot it! 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(09:33:23) Allow REG_QUERY_NAME to work even before the editor has
	fully started up. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(12:58:18) GUI changes to allow "sequence, consensus, both" as
	options for sequence search. 

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c:
	(13:01:45) Fixed various bugs in the search by sequence method.
	Forward searches in cutoff data sometimes missed hits in the cutoff
	data (when the sequence lengths vary greatly). Similarly reverse
	searches, even in used data, could miss matches too.
	
	Also added the ability to search in the consensus sequence. This is
	required for alignments like:
	
	 seq1 AT-A          seq1  GATATTA
	 seq2 A-TA    or    seq2      TTAGGA
	 cons ATTA          cons  GATATTAGGA
	
	In both cases searching for ATTA needs to check the consensus (for
	different reasons). 

	* src/seq_utils/search_utils.c,
	* src/seq_utils/search_utils.h:
	(13:03:48) Added a prstrstr_inexact function. It's the same as
	pstrstr_inexact (pad-skipping strstr with inexact match), except
	for finding the last match instead of the first match. 

	* src/gap4/legacy_f2c.c:
	(13:04:22) Rebuilt from legacy.f 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(13:05:05) Added WHERE definition for search by sequence (for
	consensus vs readings) 

	* src/gap4/tagU1.c:
	(13:09:14) Fixed the error messages from readTagList so that they
	report the correct function name (was writeTagList). 

2005-05-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.h,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c:
	(13:28:38) Added a STYLE parameter to control the display style for
	the trace. A new style known as PYRO is now present. This handles
	pyrosequencing traces whereby a single spike is present for each
	flash generated by incorporating 1 or more bases of a specific
	type.
	
	Due to this causing multiple bases at the same base, the
	trace_pyroalign function can x-scale the trace so that each base
	call has a separate column. 

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(13:30:00) Added code to use -style pyro. 

	* src/gap4/readpair.c:
	(16:01:19) Find read pairs now positions the editor at the start
	(or ends) of the readings in question instead of the start/ends of
	the contigs. This means it works more appropriately for read-pairs
	indicating one contig is contained within the other. 

2005-05-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c:
	(09:31:09) Added back serial#= line in oligo tags at users
	requests. Also only list the various scores to 2 decimal places so
	the tag fits in the editor information line. 

2005-04-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl:
	(09:22:52) Complementing a contig now repopulates the contig list
	too so that the contig name changes in the list. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(10:59:33) Added MouseWheel support for X11 systems. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(11:01:30) Added horizontal mouse wheel support. For compatibility
	with tk text and listbox widgets this uses Shift-MouseWheel.
	Consequently the old Shift-Mousehweel (slow movement) has been
	replaced by Control-MouseWheel. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(11:32:03) Fixed bug #1183748. When copying consensus tags caused
	by breaking contigs the new tags now have the strand field set
	correctly. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(16:37:47) Disabled the controls and user visible components of set
	expansion and collapsing as this is still work in progress and I do
	not want knowingly bugged interfaces available to the users in the
	source tree. 

	* src/gap4/contig_id.tcl:
	(16:40:27) Fixed broken Return key binding. Oddly this rarely makes
	any difference as the okcancelhelp overrides return to hit the Ok
	button. 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(16:41:12) Fixed various cursor movement issues (and an incorrect
	number of lines returned from linesonscreen) when dealing with
	collapsed sets. 

	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c:
	(16:42:18) Removal of debugging output 

	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	(16:45:27) Removed a block of code dealing with changing tag types.
	When adding the newer GUI tags I managed to get text for edited
	tags to be thrown away when changing tag type, instead of unedited
	text. 

	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(16:45:49) Removal of debugging information. 

2005-04-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Makefile:
	(08:21:19) Fixed space vs tab issues 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(08:28:33) Improved the "sequence sets" support for the contig
	editor. Sets may now be expanded or collapsed (they have +/- next
	to their names). Sets are also now given background colours for
	their sequence names. 

	* src/Misc/parse_db.c:
	(16:10:33) A previous of allowing \" to escape quotes broke the
	subsequent backslash parsing for \n etc. Fixed. 

	* src/gap4/complement.c:
	(16:11:43) Added missing prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/dstrand.c:
	(16:12:06) Replace cmplmt_ call with the new C complement function. 

	* src/gap4/IO2.c,
	* src/gap4/clip.c,
	* src/gap4/consen.c:
	* src/gap4/contig_order.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c,
	* src/gap4/copy_db.c,
	* src/gap4/dbcheck.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c,
	* src/gap4/do_fij.c,
	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/notes.c,
	* src/gap4/parse_ft.c,
	* src/gap4/primlib.c,
	* src/gap4/readpair.c,
	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU2.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.c,
	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c,
	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(16:15:11) Removed "might be used uninitialised" messages. Most of
	these are incorrect, but it can be useful to get the compiler to
	spot these things so initialising stuff to shut it up can be handy.
	In a couple places the error is real, but only when handling a
	severe error (such as malloc returning NULL). 

	* src/io_lib/progs/get_comment.c:
	* src/mutlib/caller_base.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/mutscan.cpp:
	* src/mutlib/read_matrix.cpp:
	* src/mutlib/sp_align_lib.cpp:
	* src/mutlib/trace.cpp,

	* src/seq_utils/read_matrix.c:
	* src/tk_utils/container.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkCanvGraph.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(16:17:35) Removed "might be used uninitialised" warning messages
	from the compiler. 

	* src/gap4/dstrand.c:
	* src/mutlib/tracediff.cpp:
	(16:22:56) Quick fix to previous edit. 

2005-04-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/sheet.c:
	(11:46:09) More checks for Tk_IsMapped. 

	* src/Makefile:
	(12:57:59) Fixed creation of lib/machine-binaries directories for
	make dist 

	* src/g/freetree.c:
	(13:02:34) Corrected "to do" messages in the comments to reflect
	the current state. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c:
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h:
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.h:
	(13:05:52) Improved the "sequence sets" support for the contig
	editor. Sets may now be expanded or collapsed (they have +/- next
	to their names). Sets are also now given background colours for
	their sequence names. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(13:07:11) Added a way to filter out known problematic templates.
	Made "fast mode" the default as it generally seems to do almost as
	well and is appropriate for a first pass too. 

	* tables/Makefile:
	(13:07:55) Added cp for haplorc. 

2005-04-25  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/Makefile,
	* src/g/freetree.c,
	* src/g/freetree.h,
	* src/g/g-db.c,
	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(09:33:38) Made the caching of freetrees an option in the Makefile
	and code that calls it. The freetree cache code is still out of
	date (as it doesn't yet support avl balance factors or the
	segregated lists) so for now it is disabled. 

	* src/tk_utils/sheet.c:
	(13:38:31) Added more Tk_IsMapped checks and assignments to
	sw->window. This may (untested) cure the intermittent crashes
	observed using redhat9 (with default? config of gnome + metacity)
	when bringing up the join editor. 

2005-04-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/freetree.c,
	* src/g/freetree.h,
	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(14:02:35) Added segregated lists to the freetree mechanism. This
	basically means a totally new tree_find_len() function and extra
	code to maintain the linked list segregations. Further
	experimentation may be needed to optimise the block rangers used
	within each list, but benchmarking shows this latest version to be
	way ahead of previous revision with regards to CPU time and also
	significantly less fragmentation (1/3rd less during assembly). 

2005-04-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/freetree.c,
	* src/g/freetree.h:
	(13:11:38) Added AVL tree balancing code. This increases
	performance greatly for some worst-case scenarios. However
	currently the freetree loading/saving code has been disabled as the
	balance factors need adding in somewhere. How to do this in a
	compatible way is unknown at present. 

2005-04-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/complement.c,
	* src/gap4/legacy.f:
	(13:53:02) Rewrote the fortran cmplmt (complement contig) in C and
	replaced sqcom and sqrev with C stub functions to use
	complement_dna and reverse_dna functions. 

	* src/gap4/IO2.c,
	* src/gap4/fort.h,
	* src/gap4/oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/probe.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU1.c:
	(13:55:14) Replaced calls to sqcom_ and sqrev_ with calls to
	complement_seq. 

2005-04-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(15:35:22) Added get_template_num sub-command to db_info 

2005-04-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c:
	(11:14:44) Checked for sets being passed in as NULL (as is the case
	when called from the sequence search, aka find_oligos, function). 

2005-03-30  James Bonfield  <jkb>

	TAG CODEBASE with rel-1-6-0b2

2005-03-29  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* Added NEWS file with summary of user-visible updates in a
	friendlier fashion.

2005-03-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(09:01:02) Added 64-bit support for linux builds. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(09:03:43) More UI tweaks: "add fake" button; cursor colouring. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_cons.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(09:04:25) Removal of debugging output. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(09:05:17) Renamed group "by grouping" to "by set". 

	* tables/haplorc:
	(09:05:46) Added cursor colourings. 

2005-03-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.c:
	(15:25:49) Added refs and sent_by fields of cursor structure to the
	tcl keyed list copy on CURSOR_NOTIFY events. 

	* src/haplo/haplo_cons.c:
	(15:27:10) Fixed the template depth calculation. 

	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	(15:28:12) Improved documentation. The plot now starts from zero
	for the contig ruler, with negative Y coordinates being the
	headings. Improved 'cursor' control. 

2005-03-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/haplo/Makefile,
	* src/haplo/haplo.h,
	* src/haplo/haplo.tcl:
	* src/haplo/haplo_cons.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_snps.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_split.c,
	* src/haplo/haplo_tcl.c:
	(15:16:51) First draft of haplotype/repeat splitting interface. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contigEditor.h,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edCommands.c,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(15:23:23) Added the notion of "sets" to the editor structures and
	GUI. This basically i a way of grouping readings into distinct sets
	and a way of showing only one set at a time in the editor.
	
	The plan is for sets to become more widely used, for breaking
	contigs apart, etc. 

	* src/gap4/allelic_discreps.c:
	(15:31:20) Probably last version and to be deprecated - just
	changed for some debugging / logging output. 

	* src/gap4/check_assembly.c,
	* src/gap4/fij.c,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/find_repeats.c:
	(16:11:39) Updated to change for the new argument syntax of
	edit_contig(). 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.h,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl:
	(16:18:34) Renamed the existing discrepancy plot to be a "diploid
	descrepancy" plot and added a new discrepancy plot that excludes
	the code to check if the frequency matches an expected 50/50 ratio. 

	* src/Makefile:
	(16:56:11) Added haplo subdirectory. 

	* src/gap4/io-reg.c:
	(17:17:13) It's scary to notice oddities with the low-level contig
	registration scheme after all these years. The contig_notify system
	when given contig 0 as a placeholder meaning "all contigs" now
	sends over the correct contig number when calling the callback
	functions rather than zero. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(17:19:18) Addition of a contig_lock_write tcl interface. Also
	updated the discrepancy plot arguments (-two_alleles). 

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(17:22:09) In process_discrep the confidence values are now
	computed in a marginally different way (same maths, but more
	robust). Computing "number close to 1" and then doing 1-that gives
	precision problems, but computing the 1-value directly yields more
	accurate results. Consequently the confidence scores can be much
	higher without data precisison truncation. 

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c:
	(17:23:16) Changed calls to calc_quality due to contEd_info
	prototype change. 

	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.c:
	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.h:
	(17:24:17) Added REG_LENGTH support and cursor locking calls for
	the tcl interface to io-reg. 

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(17:26:03) Took out the limit of only being able to remove virtual
	sequences from a virtual contig. We can now populate it with real
	sequences and remove real sequences that we do not wish to be in
	the computed consensus (for example). Also removed some debugging
	output. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(17:28:04) Fixed usage output. 

	* src/pregap4/pregap4,
	* src/spin/spin,
	* src/trev/trev:
	(17:29:02) Added MACHINE support for linux-ia64. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.h:
	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c,
	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(17:30:42) Added support for a -trace_scale option in trev (and
	report usage too). In the widget this overrides the auto-scaling to
	maxTraceVal. 

	* src/tk_utils/user_defaults.tcl:
	(17:31:20) Removal of debugging output. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(17:32:22) *** empty log message *** 

	* tables/haplorc:
	(17:32:51) First version of the config for the haplo gap4 package. 

2005-03-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/copy_db.c:
	(16:24:56) Added code to fix the min..max size of templates (if min
	> max). 

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(16:31:52) Highlight disagreements by dots now uses ":" to display
	bases that differ but are below the quality threshold. 

2005-03-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/tman_display.c:
	(11:54:27) Fixed "embedded traces" in the Join Editor. 

2005-02-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(16:49:43) Changed mask variable sent to find_repeats so that
	masking repeats actually does something. 

2005-02-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(10:08:03) Added getABIIndexEntrySW and modified getABIString to
	correctly determine the string type (pascal vs C-string). This
	means MODL numbers now come out as 3730 instead of 730 (for
	example). 

2005-02-04  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(14:21:47) Fixed a bug in the reading to contig number caching
	caused by joining the last contig in the database to another. 

	* src/gap4/seqInfo.c:
	(14:25:00) Removed a memory leak and a potential free of an
	undefined pointer. 

2005-01-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/sheet.c:
	(12:31:04) Fixed bug #1105931.
	
	Initialise the sw->window to zero in sheet_create. This means that
	starting the join editor on the default (ie "next") match for Find
	Internal Joins on the demo/gap/DEMO.0 database does not crash on
	Windows.
	
	I do not know why the lack of initialisation was so data specific
	and OS specific. Valgrind reports no problems on linux and in
	theory this is correct (as sw->window shouldn't be accessed until
	after it's been initialised for real, due to Tk_IsMapped calls
	elsewhere). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(15:06:31) Added auto-scrolling when dragging out a selection
	beyond the boundaries of the editor text widget. 

2005-01-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(10:25:32) Fixed bug #1104453. We now fill out the qual2
	"2nd-highest confidence" array when using the base frequencies or
	weighted base frequencies algorithms. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c:
	(11:40:32) Fixed bug #1104446.
	
	When the user configures the contig editor width to be different to
	the default the display was drawn at the default width until the
	next resize event. 

2004-12-06  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Misc/vlen.c:
	(17:25:45) Moved va_list variable into the #ifdef block so that the
	variable is only declared when used. 

	* src/gap4/consen.c:
	(17:31:54) Addec ctype.h include for prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/extract.c:
	(17:35:34) Removal of unused variables. 

	* src/gap4/gap_utils.tcl:
	(17:37:03) Optimisations of obtaining reading names and getting the
	left most reading (quicker now to convert to contig number and read
	left-most rather than chain left). 

	* src/gap4/oligo.h:
	(17:39:09) Added createTmpAnnotation prototype. 

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(17:41:18) Removal of unused variables. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(17:41:58) Corrected minor compiler warnings. 

	* src/mk/linux.mk:
	(17:43:47) Added -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 to enable 64-bit file
	offset support. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_pcr.c:
	(17:45:08) Used %"PRId64" instead of %ld for printf of
	(casted)strlen result. This is the official C9X syntax. 

	* src/prefinish/tooltips.tcl:
	(17:51:44) Temporary fix - catch{} the tooltip_font creation as the
	contig editor may also have created this font. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkSheet_common.c:
	(17:53:05) Cancel the idle call of the SheetDisplay function when
	destroying a sheet widget. This fixed a race condition triggerable
	by scripts (but apparently not in gap4 itself) whereby SheetDisplay
	could get called on a destroyed sheet. 

	* tables/config.prefinish:
	(17:53:50) An improved "prefinish" GUI config. 

	* src/gap4/IO.c,
	* src/gap4/IO.h,
	* src/gap4/io_utils.c,
	* src/gap4/io_utils.h:
	(17:55:18) Added a cache of reading-number to contig-number
	conversions. The rnumtocnum and chain_left functions now use this
	in prefernce to taking a brute-force approach. There are also
	functions for update_rnumtocnum and invalidate_rnumtocnum to ensure
	this information does not become inconsistent. 

	* src/gap4/IO2.c,
	* src/gap4/IO3.c,
	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c,
	* src/gap4/join.c:
	* src/gap4/preass.c:
	(17:56:26) Added calls to update_rnumtocnum and
	invalidate_rnumtocnum to make sure the new cache of reading numbers
	to contig numbers is kept in sync. 

	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl:
	(17:56:50) A major rewrite of UpdateContigList; it is now
	substantially faster. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(17:57:50) Added a get_contig_nums sub-method to the db_info
	command (in addition to the existing get_contig_num call). Some of
	the other db_info methods now return 64-bit results. 

	* src/gap4/template_display.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.h:
	(17:58:16) CalcTotalReadingLen, CalcTotalContigLen and
	CalcLongContig now all return 64-bit data types. 

	* src/gap4/dbcheck.c:
	(17:59:34) We now check the rnumtocnum cache in memory matches the
	GContigs and GReadings structures. This checking code also
	auto-corrects any problems it finds (in addition to complaining
	about them). 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(18:00:21) Use Tcl wide() cast to display 64-bit integers (now
	returned from db_info). 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl:
	(18:02:22) Tags added to canvas items are now also stored in a hash
	(indexed by contig number). This provides a substantially faster
	way to lookup canvas items for a specific contig number. (The
	canvas findtag methods appear to be O(N^2) complexity for N canvas
	items.) 

	* src/gap4/auto_assemble.c:
	(18:08:55) Added calls to update_rnumtocnum and
	invalidate_rnumtocnum to make sure the new cache of reading numbers
	to contig numbers is kept in sync. 

2004-11-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO2.c:
	(14:58:36) Replaced memcpy with memmove in io_delete_contig.
	Somehow it used to work anyway, but was presumably
	compiler/C-library dependant. 

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(14:59:40) Removed a redundant call to destroy_alignment_params
	which was causing memory to be freed twice and giving malloc
	problems. 

2004-11-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/io_utils.c:
	(09:24:16) Massive speedup of lget_contig_num changing it from
	O(N^2) to O(N) in complexity. The offending double-loop sped up by
	100,000 times when run on 50000 contigs from 2.6million reads. 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(09:25:32) Used PRId64 for printf type in db_info so that functions
	returning int64_t get passed back to Tcl correctly. 

2004-11-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/Makefile,
	* src/g/dependencies,
	* src/g/freetree-io.h,
	* src/g/freetree.c,
	* src/g/freetree.h,
	* src/g/g-db.c:
	* src/g/g-debug.c,
	* src/g/g-error.c,
	* src/g/g-error.h,
	* src/g/g-filedefs.h,
	* src/g/g-files.c,
	* src/g/g-io.c,
	* src/g/g-io.h,
	* src/g/g-os.h,
	* src/g/g-request.c,
	* src/g/g-struct.c,
	* src/g/g-struct.h:
	(09:49:41) Added support for 64-bit offsets in AUX files. This
	means that Gap4 databases can be larger than 2Gb. Support for
	32-bit is still maintained for backwards compatibility.
	
	The main heart of this is to redefine the GImage data type to be an
	8-byte integer and to split the functions in g-io pointed to by
	low_level_vectors into 32-bit and 64-bit versions. 

	* src/Misc/os.h:
	(09:56:17) Added int8 type and corresponding swapping functions.
	Also added printf macros, if missing, (for %ld, %d, %lld, etc) as
	defined by C9X. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db_main.c:
	(09:57:34) Added a -b option to define the output database bitsize
	(for the aux file). Also rewrote the argument parsing to use
	getopt() instead. 

	* src/gap4/f2c.c,
	* src/gap4/legacy.f:
	(09:59:06) Split the swritf function into a series of swrt1, swrt2,
	etc functions. Each of these are identical interfaces to the same
	underlying function, but from fortran we make sure to never call
	the same function with a different number or different type of
	arguments (as fortran technically doesn't support varargs). This
	removes the compiler warnings from g77. 

	* src/gap4/gap-create.c,
	* src/gap4/gap-create.h,
	* src/gap4/gap.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(10:00:27) Added support for 64-bit aux files. 

	* src/mutlib/array.hpp:
	(10:02:59) Worked around a problem (a real bug perhaps? or maybe
	just a compiler oddity) when compiling with gcc 3.4.
	
	If template A contains protected members and template B derives
	itself from template A, then we cannot directly access the
	protected members of A within B. Instead we need to explicitly
	specify the template search path or use this->member. 

2004-11-18  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/enter_tags.tcl:
	(11:28:50) Fixed typo causing Tcl error in Enter Tags. 

	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	(11:29:38) Consensus tags now honour the unpadded_tags switch. 

2004-11-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(12:10:16) Major speed up of reading large experiment files. Tested
	on a 1Mb sequence with AV, ON and SQ lines the new code is 1000
	times faster on the Alpha.
	
	Primarily the difference comes from removing O(N^2) complexities by
	removing strcat & strlen type of operations. 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c:
	(14:23:26) Major speed improvements in plot_confidence() for qual
	arrays that contain runs of the same value. In this case we
	collapse the items into a single horizontal ruler. On test projects
	this seemed to give 10-20 fold speedups of plotting and subsequent
	canvas operations. 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c,
	* src/gap4/consistency_canvas_box.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c:
	* src/gap4/gap_canvas_box.c,
	* src/gap4/plot_quality.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	* src/tk_utils/canvas_box.c,
	* src/tk_utils/element_canvas.c,
	* src/tk_utils/ruler_tick.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkRaster.c:
	(15:41:58) In lots of places we sprintf to command strings to pass
	over to Tcl. Those involved with scale factors (eg scaling down
	10Mb to 600 pixels) often up with as .000???, so the default %f
	format loses precision. These have been changed to %.20f (and the
	buffer sizes checked to make sure they cope).
	
	This corrects a bug with displayed positions in the gap4
	consistency plots not matching those shown in the contig editor,
	and probably many other similar bugs too. 

	* src/gap4/stop_codon.c:
	* src/spin/nip_stop_codon.c:
	(17:10:55) Removed the limitations on the maximum number (was
	10000) of stop codons found. 

	* src/gap4/stop_codon.c:
	(17:34:26) Fixed a bug with all stop codons beyond the unpadded
	length being "modulo"d back to the start of the contig. Stops at
	the end now appear correctly.

2004-11-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* staden.login,
	* staden.profile:
	(17:55:25) Added IA64 support for MACHINE. 

	* src/Misc/Makefile:
	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(17:56:23) Automatically create the lib/$MACHINE-binaries
	directory. 

	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.c,
	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.h:
	(17:57:52) Added a get_protein_lookup() method to avoid direct
	access to the protein_lookup global. This resolves gcc -O2
	compilation woes using mingw on MS Windows. 

	* src/spin/readpam.c:
	(17:58:32) Now uses get_protein_lookup() instead of accessing the
	global protein_lookup variable. 

	* src/windows/run/Makefile:
	(17:59:09) Added -mwindows to gcc line; this prevents the DOS box
	from appearing at start up. 

2004-11-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* README.build:
	(09:28:35) Updated build instructions. 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(09:31:31) Now checks out a specific dated version of itcl (equiv
	to the Windows 3.3 build). 
	(16:29:24) Fix itcl/iwidgets builds (to work with the cvs checkout
	version). 

	* Makefile:
	* src/Makefile:
	* src/prefinish/Makefile:
	* Makefile:
	(16:28:05) More distrib building tidyups. 

	* Version:

	* src/tk_utils/help_choose.tcl:
	(16:30:50) Auto now looks for mozilla first. 

	* lib/phrap/phrap.tcl:
	(16:51:25) (Fix from Niklas Wikstrom). Updated disassemble_readings
	call to use the new syntax.

	(16:54:44) Updated version to 1.3 

2004-10-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/mk/linux-ia64.mk:
	(10:24:23) Itanium/gcc support. 

	* doc/manual/tools/update-nodes:
	(10:32:30) Use $0 when finding update-nodes.el so that calling this
	script from other directories (eg ../scripting) still works. This
	fixes a bug introduced in the last modification to this file. 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(10:41:39) Use .built-$(O) instead of .built so we can
	clean/rebuild for different OSes in the same source tree. 

	* src/io_lib/Makefile:
	(10:42:10) Automatically create binary output directories. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(10:42:46) Fixed bug with the right-click menu (it didn't exist!) 

2004-10-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(09:02:28) Allow for backgrounds to be blank, to disable it. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(09:03:56) Set the default background colour list to "" (ie just
	the usual grey). 

	* lib/Makefile:
	(09:15:53) Various updates for distribution building 

	* src/Makefile,
	* src/mutlib/Makefile,
	* src/tk_utils/Makefile:
	(09:15:56) Various updates for distribution building 

	* src/Makefile.thirdparty:
	(15:27:28) A new Makefile to download, compile and locally-install
	the required third party packages. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(16:53:29) Compile and link against root/src/lib instead of
	root/lib. 

2004-10-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/spin_emboss/acd2tcl.tcl:
	(09:31:16) Updated to work with the latest ACD specification used
	in Emboss 2.9.0. This meant adding toggle and directory types. 

	* src/spin_emboss/create_emboss_files.tcl:
	(09:32:35) Updated to look for ACDs in share instead of share/data
	(change meaning it works with emboss 2.9.0). 

	* src/spin_emboss/emboss_utils.tcl,
	* src/spin_emboss/tclIndex:
	(09:33:44) Added an init_dialogue function and other bits to cope
	with the new implicit "acdprotein" variable. Now works with emboss
	2.9.0. 

	* tables/emboss_menu:
	(09:35:58) Regenerated from emboss 2.9.0. 

        * gaprc:
	(10:46:29) Improved the choice of background colours. Thanks Nancy!

	* src/Makefile:
	(10:23:56) Updated distrib building. 

	* src/pregap4/templates.tcl:
	(10:24:54) Disabled the filebrowser memory of last directory for
	the add naming scheme / config template. 

	* src/spin/tkSeqedUtils.c:

	(09:14:49) "variable:" records are now read and written to the tag. 

2004-10-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(14:15:12) Changed the default value for -ignore_vec on
	assemble_direct as it appears that I had the backwards compatible
	behaviour backwards. 

2004-10-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(16:45:37) In guess_references we now look for best quality
	"differing" traces against either strand, rather than only
	top-strand. This helps with hets when maybe top & bottom strand
	both get difference base calls. 

2004-10-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(14:47:16) Added a "show read-pair traces" option to the editor.
	This controls whether the opposite strand trace for this template
	should be automatically shown when invoking the trace display.
	
	Also, for contig_editor.tcl only, added mousewheel support. 

	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(14:47:34) Added a "show read-pair traces" option to the editor.
	This controls whether the opposite strand trace for this template
	should be automatically shown when invoking the trace display.
	
	Also, for contig_editor.tcl only, added mousewheel support. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(14:49:06) Fixed a divide-by-zero error in the normalisation code. 

	* src/tk_utils/text_output.c:
	(14:49:46) Better handling of verror/vmessage usage when Tk hasn't
	been initialised. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:50:11) Added mousewheel support. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(14:50:38) Added "Show Read-pair Traces" to the editor settings
	menu. 

2004-10-07  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/mutlib/trace.cpp:
	(16:16:01) Downscale to +/-16384 when differencing traces (instead
	of the previous 32768) as not all displays cope correctly with
	trace samples > 32768. 

	* src/mutlib/align.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/mutscan.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/mutscan_analysis.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/mutscan_preprocess.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/sp_align_lib.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/tracealign.cpp:
	(16:17:16) Removal of debugging information. 

	* src/gap4/tman_diff.c:
	(16:20:19) Changed the Y-scale algorithm to use the normalization
	code from convert_trace. This works much better. 

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(16:21:20) If auto-diff is enabled but no negative references have
	been found, we now automatically pick the best discrepant template
	and use that instead. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(16:21:51) Shortened the "title" attached to difference traces. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(16:24:21) Added CONTIG_EDITOR.NAMES_XPOS option to control the
	default scrollbar position in the editor sequence names display. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(17:16:41) sort_seq_by_template() is now a stable sort. Call
	sort_seq_by_strand prior to calling by template so that sequences
	within a template are now always listed in +/- strand order. 

2004-10-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(16:10:54) Allow the default editor-names X scrollbar position to
	be set in the gaprc file. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(16:14:02) The reference sequence is now forced to be top whenever
	the sequences are grouped by anything other than position. (For now
	this cannot be done with group-by-position as this HAS to be sorted
	by position for searches to work correctly.) 

	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c:
	(16:15:16) When auto-diff is enabled but no references have been
	set, gap4 now still always brings up the top and bottom strand
	sequences instead of reverting back to only the trace you
	requested. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(16:16:07) When the editor names panel is showing template names
	instead of reading names, the trace display now does the same. 

2004-10-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/progs/convert_trace.c:
	(10:56:07) Rewrote rescale_heights (the "-normalise" option) using
	an amplitude tracker with an attack & delay model. This seems to
	work well at adjusting for both gradual amplitude variations and
	for downscaling huge dye-blobs. 

2004-09-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* Version:
	(13:52:30) *** empty log message *** 

	* ChangeLog:
	(14:03:44) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(14:43:59) Change directory now (via some naughty internal hacking)
	clears the filebrowsers "last rememembered directory". 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/readpair.c,
	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(16:17:44) Fixed displaying/listing of template sizes for the
	"<---- .... ---->" case. Previously these could be considered as
	consistent is the ABS(end-start) value was correct, but we now take
	notice of t->direction for working out end-start vs start-end
	instead of using ABS(). 

2004-09-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/allelic_discreps.h:
	(10:35:38) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/f2c.h:
	(10:38:54) *** empty log message *** 

2004-09-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/acd2tag.tcl:
	(16:28:27) Added "namespaces" into tags. These get converted into
	multiple tabs so that the tag contents can be duplicated up to
	produce subtags within a single tag.
	
	Added text and label data types. 

	* src/gap4/allelic_discreps.c:
	(16:29:31) Main allelic_discreps function now returns a tcl list
	instead of just spewing to stdout. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(16:32:17) Editor sequence-name panel now remembers the X scrollbar
	position between contig editor uses (within a single session).
	
	Experimental "tag popup" system. Currently only suitable for the
	inhouse ExoSeq project and so disabled in the default gaprc.
	
	"Show template names" option to toggle whether reading names or
	template names are shown in the left name panel.
	
	The "Join to" function now attempts to automatically complement a
	contig if required (based on read-pair primer types). 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c:
	(16:32:46) Addition of edSetTemplateNameMode/edGetTemplateNameMode
	functions. 

	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(16:34:30) Code for toggling the sequence-name and template-name
	shown in the left names panel. 

	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(16:34:31) Code for toggling the sequence-name and template-name
	shown in the left names panel. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(16:35:32) Use of CONTIG_EDITOR.SEARCH.AUTO_EDIT_TAG to determine
	whether a tag search automatically brings up the tag editor to view
	it. 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(16:36:02) 4.10b4 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(16:36:27) allelic_discreps now returns a Tcl list to the caller
	containing the results. 

	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU1.c,
	* src/gap4/tagUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	(16:39:26) The edit/create annotation code now returns (from C to
	Tcl) the Tk pathname of the newly created window.
	
	CONTIG_EDITOR.MACRO_AUTOEDIT used to determine whether the tag
	editor should be launched after creation of a tag via a macro.
	
	Bug fix to the GUI tag creation code (tag name vs typeid issues). 

	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c:
	(16:40:34) The xview method now returns the current slider position
	when no arguments are given. 

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(16:41:30) Added xx->template_names check to determine whether to
	view sequence or template names. 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(16:46:09) Various toggles (STRAND_COVERAGE.PROBLEM.VALUE,
	CONTIG_EDITOR.LIST_CONFIDENCE.ONLY_NUM_ERRS) plus new menus/options
	for new features ("show template names" in editor, tag popups for
	ExoSeq project). 

	* tables/shlib.conf:
	(16:46:24) Added linux-ia64 support. 

2004-09-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/extract.c:
	(15:43:51) Fixed a bug where the filenames extracted did not match
	the contents of the file. An extract followed by a directed
	assembly did not reveal problems as the filenames are irrelevant -
	the contents of the filenames were all present still (but in wrong
	files). 

2004-08-17  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Misc/parse_db.c:
	(13:27:50) Allow backslashes for escaping quotes (and obviously
	therefore also backslashes themselves). 

	* src/gap4/acd2tag.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	(13:34:36) Added "gui tags". This uses a hacked copy of the emboss
	acd->tcl conversion code, but specifically it is designed for
	generating gui frames instead of entire top-level windows.
	
	Any tag type with a default-text starting in "#!acdtag:" is
	considered to be in an ACD-like syntax and the default text then
	describes the format instead of the tag text contents. 

	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(13:35:16) Added acd2tag::parse lookup 

	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile,
	* src/io_lib/progs/Makefile.am,
	* src/io_lib/progs/ztr_dump.c:
	(13:37:17) Added a ztr_dump program. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(13:38:02) Fixed the auto-directory making target. 

2004-08-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/abi/Makefile,
	* src/abi/getABIfield.c:
	(16:31:14) Complete rewrite of the ABI file reading code so that it
	can now load directly from in-memory structures.
	
	This is within getABIfield.c which is now a general purpose abi
	dump and so replaces all the other getABI* programs. 

2004-08-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_order.tcl:
	(09:20:00) Added missing file for "Order Contigs" code. 

	* src/io_lib/progs/index_tar.c:
	(09:32:05) Fix bug submitted by Steve Leonard. If a directory is
	too large to fit in the name (>100) but short enough to fit in the
	prefix the name field will be empty, this is not the cas for
	ordinary files where the name field is always non-empty. 

2004-07-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(10:28:13) Binary output directories are now automatically made. 

2004-07-26  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/eba/Makefile,
	* src/eba/conf.c,
	* src/eba/conf.h,
	* src/eba/qual.c:
	(10:45:20) Calibration & make setup changes. 

	* README.build:
	(14:21:46) Added MinGW windows build instructions. 

	* src/Misc/os.h,
	* src/Misc/usleep.c:
	* src/g/g-error.c,

	* src/tk_utils/tkCanvGraph.c:
	* src/windows/run/Makefile,
	* src/windows/run/main.cpp:
	* tables/iwidgetsrc:
	(14:30:10) MinGW port 

2004-07-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/oligo.h,
	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(10:53:51) Added a "prev" button to the contig editor's "select
	primer" interface. 

2004-07-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Misc/vlen.c:
	(10:39:25) Added a va_copy call in vflen for systems where va_list
	is a pointer. The NEED_VA_COPY define comes from the system
	specific bits of os.h 

	* src/Misc/os.h:
	(10:41:28) Define NEED_VA_COPY macro for amd64 systems. (see vlen.c
	for its use) 

2004-07-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* doc/manual/tools/update-nodes:
	(11:38:51) From Gintautas Grigelionis.
	
	Updated the search path for the update-nodes.el script. (uses
	$STADENROOT/manual.) 

	* src/mk/linux.mk:
	(13:02:38) Added comments for alternative options needed on AMD64
	systems. 

	* src/primer3/src/Makefile:
	(13:04:17) Added SHLIB_CFLAGS to the primer3 library building code. 

2004-07-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(11:37:13) more diagnostic output on templates: score, consistency,
	flags. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	(11:38:22) When -no_consensus is true we now still set
	fin->vc->cons. This means that link_vrseq will no longer complain.
	
	Updated version to 1.31 

2004-06-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	(14:29:29) Updated to use Tk8.4.6.
	
	Reapplied local patches to listbox.tcl, palette.tcl, tkfbox.tcl and
	xmfbox.tcl. Local patch to tearoff.tcl is no longer needed (it made
	it into the core dist.) 

	* lib/tk/images/README,
	* lib/tk/msgs/fr.msg,
	* lib/tk/msgs/nl.msg:
	(14:29:45) Updated to use Tk8.4.6.
	
	Reapplied local patches to listbox.tcl, palette.tcl, tkfbox.tcl and
	xmfbox.tcl. Local patch to tearoff.tcl is no longer needed (it made
	it into the core dist.) 

2004-06-29  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap_hash.c:
	(12:56:51) Find Repeats now depads the sequence first. (Func
	repeat_search) 

2004-06-24  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(14:12:56) Fixed the Save button. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(15:56:06) Improved text output to indicate both left and right
	contig ends where known while splitting. 

	* src/gap4/break_contig.c:
	(15:56:07) Improved text output to indicate both left and right
	contig ends where known while splitting. 

	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(16:13:34) Removed the add_tag_menus function. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(16:16:31) The editor 'edit tag' and 'delete tag' sub-menus now
	auto-cascade when there are too many tags visible at one point. 

2004-06-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(10:12:01) Added TEMP_CONSIST_INTERDIST as a type of error
	indicating that the size constraint on a template has been broken
	when we attempt to butt contigs against one another (working on the
	assumption that any valid overlap would have been made already).
	The TEMP_OFLAG_INTERDIST flag can be set to enable this search to
	be made (which is off by default; previously it was enabled and
	produced CONSIST_DIST errors).
	
	Added template_check_set_flags() function to ease setting a flag
	for all templates in the template_c array. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(10:14:35) Added TEMP_OFLAG_INTERDIST flag to template_c structs.
	Necessitated by the change in template.c in order to keep behaviour
	in edUtils2.c the same as the previous revision. 

	* src/gap4/template_display.c:
	(10:17:02) Added comment about using TEMP_OFLAG_INTERDIST. It's not
	enabled here, but this means it has an operation different to the
	previous version (as template.c has changed, not this file). 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c:
	(10:18:06) Splitted the template status code "D" into "D" and "d".
	Uppercase indicates impossible distance issues (ie negative size)
	and lowercase indicates less severe out of range sizes. 

2004-06-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(09:04:17) Check for the alignment buffer introducing more pads
	than the sequence length dictates there should be. This was causing
	read-past-end of buffer (depad_to_pad[]) in some rare cases and
	hence causing the join editor align button to hang or crash. 

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(09:28:05) Join editor "Align" button output now trims the right
	hand alignment edge (for runs of pads) in addition to left end. 

2004-06-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/io-reg.c:
	(13:46:57) Improved debug info to log file. 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.h,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(13:48:45) Added new graph types and added the allelic_discreps Tcl
	binding (meant to be in last update, but missed). 

2004-06-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/eba/Makefile,
	* src/eba/conf.c,
	* src/eba/conf.h,
	* src/eba/qual.c:
	(08:28:55) Added secondary phred-scale lookup table from
	callibration of new confidence assignment mode. 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl:
	(15:56:41) Added a catch around a visibility wait as in some cases
	it errors. Unknown why! 

	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.c,
	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(15:58:53) Added template to the gel_info query. 

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(16:00:06) Added a visual cue of the contig length and the match
	position within that contig. 

	* src/gap4/Makefile,
	* src/gap4/allelic_discreps.c,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c,
	* src/gap4/qual.c,
	* src/gap4/qual.h:
	(16:08:27) New discrepancy calculations and plots computed via
	calc_consensus and calc_discrepancies. The second-highest
	confidence may be returned from calc_consensus() if cons2 is passed
	as NULL but qual2 is not. This is plotted via the 2nd-highest
	confidence graph.
	
	A new function calc_discrepancies(), based on calc_consensus,
	computes the second highest confidence value at each base position
	along with an estimation of how likely it is that we have two
	haplotypes fitting a 50/50 ratio.
	
	The allelic_discreps function (currently exported to Tcl, but with
	no user interface) uses calc_discrepancies to attempt to pull apart
	an assembly mixed from two haplotypes. 

	* src/gap4/Makefile:
	(16:40:37) Rewrote all calls to the FORTRAN WRITE() call from
	legacy.f as SWRITF() instead. This is our own function (in f2c.c)
	designed to act much like a printf style command. The purpose of
	this is to allow f2c generated code (legacy_f2c.c) to work without
	needing any of the fortran run-time library and hence make building
	on platforms without a fortran compiler substantially easier to do. 

	* src/gap4/f2c.c,
	* src/gap4/legacy.f,
	* src/gap4/legacy_f2c.c:
	(16:40:38) Rewrote all calls to the FORTRAN WRITE() call from
	legacy.f as SWRITF() instead. This is our own function (in f2c.c)
	designed to act much like a printf style command. The purpose of
	this is to allow f2c generated code (legacy_f2c.c) to work without
	needing any of the fortran run-time library and hence make building
	on platforms without a fortran compiler substantially easier to do. 

	* src/gap4/quality_plot.c:
	(16:42:58) Replaced fmtdb_ in fortran with a local fmtdb, to avoid
	requirements of fortran WRITE() call. 

	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c:
	(16:43:50) Add tag pointer into Tk window pathname. It's a hack,
	but it means that multiple tags with tagid 0 (newly created ones)
	can be edited without clashes. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(16:44:35) Fixed error message for TraceCmd. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(16:46:44) Added new consistency/confidence graph menu items. 

	* tables/trevrc:
	(16:47:36) Use trace "orig_format" instead of "format" widget
	command when determining type to save under. This means that we can
	edit and save back to experiment files once more (ie fixes a bug). 

2004-06-14  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c:
	(16:19:00) Improved the cryptic warning messages output by FIJ. 

2004-06-09  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/eba/conf.c,
	* src/eba/qual.c:
	(17:30:48) Added various command line options to turn on/off
	averaging and to turn on a "filtered" method of calling confidence
	values. Enabling both this and the old method takes the minimum of
	either in a "pessimistic" approach. 

2004-06-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:11:52) Added gui component/defaults for "ignore svec clips" in
	directed assembly. 

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c:
	(14:15:25) Added an "ignore svec (SL/SR) clips" option to directed
	assembly. The default behaviour (not ignore) is how the 2003 staden
	package worked, but not 1.4 and 1.4.1. 

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.h,
	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(14:15:29) Added an "ignore svec (SL/SR) clips" option to directed
	assembly. The default behaviour (not ignore) is how the 2003 staden
	package worked, but not 1.4 and 1.4.1. 

2004-06-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/ltmain.sh,
	* src/io_lib/missing,
	* src/io_lib/mkinstalldirs:
	(08:54:43) Updated notes to claim this is version 1.8.12 and
	rebuilt all the automake/autoconf/libtool generated files. 

	* src/io_lib/abi/Makefile.in,
	* src/io_lib/alf/Makefile.in:
	(08:54:50) Updated notes to claim this is version 1.8.12 and
	rebuilt all the automake/autoconf/libtool generated files.

	(08:54:51) Updated notes to claim this is version 1.8.12 and
	rebuilt all the automake/autoconf/libtool generated files. 

2004-05-24  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c:
	(08:42:47) Improved information added to oligo tags: now has Tm,
	GC, quality. 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c:
	(08:53:13) Add force_comment call to edSetBriefTag(), meaning that
	tag searches now update the information line correctly. 

2004-05-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(15:54:14) Added keybindings to use XF86_Switch_VT_1 in addition to
	Shift-Key-F1 (and so on) as this appears to be how the newer
	XFree86 default xmodmap is configured.
	
	Unfortunately XF86_Switch_VT_1 is only in XFree86's keysymdb,
	meaning that using a linux xserver and a (for example) digital unix
	client will still work as Gap4 on digital unix cannot bind to an
	unknown keysym. 

2004-05-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(16:14:10) Improved spacing fix. 

2004-05-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	(08:27:40) Applied change suggested by Saul A. Kravitz. The
	fallback fspacing is now calculated over the range that basecalls
	exist rather than the total length of trace. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c:
	(13:35:43) Fixed incorrect repositioning of the editor window when
	new plots were brought up. Caused due to the CONTIG_REG
	notification triggering a CURSOR_NOTIFY event using the editor
	internal sequence number instead of the external reading number. 
2004-05-11  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/gaprc:
	Set the default Sequence Search percentage match to be 100% (was
	75%).

	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	Version 1.8b1.
	Use trace "orig_format" command instead of "format" for working
	out if the trace is experiment file or not. This corrects a bug
	caused by the io_lib change of 2004-01-13 whereby EXP files were
	considered to be in the format of the trace file they referenced
	by trev and hence could not be saved to.

	* src/tk_utils/xyesno.tcl:
	Improving packing layout.
	
	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	Added an "orig_format" widget command.

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl,
	* src/gap4/gap.tcl,
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c,
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.h,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(08:42:13) More template check parameters are now exposed to the
	user via the Configure menu. Specifically this includes what data
	we filter out as possibly incorrect (prime type; all or just
	custom) and the minimum length of vector SVEC tags before we
	consider them to be valid. (Both are in template.c already, but
	previously only controlled programatically.) 

	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(08:43:10) Corrected OFLAG flags so that they are proper
	bit-patterns rather than 'overlapping' each other causing bugs. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(08:44:28) Added default definitions for the new template status
	checking options. 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(08:44:54) Renamed the template size tolerance function to
	something more appropriate. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(08:46:23) Added a "Join to..." menu to the editor names panel.
	This brings up a join editor between the current sequence and the
	one linked to (provided they are in different contigs). 

	* staden.login,
	* staden.profile:
	(10:24:56) Updated the MANPATH handling to use the "manpath"
	command where available for finding the default. 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(12:28:00) SF Bug #914027. The sequence search now honours the
	start/end ranges. 

2004-05-07  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/Makefile:
	(13:10:58) xrelink target to do the same as relink, in case relink
	is overloaded elsewhere. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	(13:12:36) Reenabled the Any-Configure binding once more. It
	probably breaks resizing in some cases, but without it twm was
	giving zero sized windows.
	
	One day... one day, I'll finally get around to rewriting this mess! 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(13:13:29) Improved usage messages and error messages when DISPLAY
	not set.
	
	Updated version to 4.10b2 

	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/template.h:
	(13:16:55) Added a minimum length of vector (min_vector_len) to
	consider as valid, in order to ignore a few base pairs erroneously
	tagged at the end of sequences due to random matches. (This is a
	bug in vector clipping programs, but it happens often.)
	
	Added a TEMP_OFLAG_IGNORE_PTYPE flag so that the primer type
	information can be completely ignored when trying to work out
	template positions. Instead it relies purely on the location of
	sequences and vector tags. This is to work around databases with
	incorrectly entered data. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(13:18:45) Edited TEXTUTILS_LIB definition to have TEXTUTILS_LIB_E
	at the end, rather than second to end. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.c:
	(14:44:53) Renamed key_t to fkey_t to avoid conflicts under MinGW. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_hash.c:
	(15:24:19) Reduced the spamminess of the best oligo match output by
	only printing up failed ones. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c:
	(15:25:56) Added extra min_vector_len parameter into
	finish_clip_svec call. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(15:28:20) Check for the new -penalise_overlaps option.
	
	Set TEMP_OFLAG_IGNORE_PTYPE flag the template struct before
	checking for validity if -chk_template_stat == 0. Pass over the
	-min_vector_len parameter too. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	(15:29:13) Extended the -ends only mode to give scores for
	improving low quality, even though it still only tries to extend
	contigs. Added a -regexp_templates 1 option to switch back to the
	previous default mechanism. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.c:
	(15:30:23) Make use of the -min_vector_len option in the
	find_cloning_cector and finish_svec_clip functions. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.h:
	(15:30:39) Make use of the -min_vector_len option in the
	find_cloning_cector and finish_svec_clip functions. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(15:35:06) Decreased the impact of primer3 scores on the
	'cost_mult' parameter. It's now *= 1+score/50 instead of *=
	1+score/20.
	
	When -chk_template_stat == 0 we now set the template ranges to be
	the observed location of vector +/- 1Kb.
	
	"Solution not adjoining problem end" is now multiplicative in cost
	rather than additive.
	
	Tweaks for start location of where to search for primers when we're
	trying to solve a + strand problem from the right end (ie the left
	end failed) and where start != end. We back up from the requested
	pos by half a read length. 

	* src/scripts/embl2exp:
	(16:25:26) New script: a quick hack to convert EMBL to EXP by using
	a gap4 database as an intermediate format. 

2004-04-28  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/seq_utils/search_utils.c:
	(09:21:45) Fixed a 'read past buffer end' bug in pstrstr and
	pstrstr_inexact, leading to possible crashes, but more likely to
	false matches being reported.
	
	The problem occured when 'text' ended in a pad. 

2004-04-26  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	Update version to 4.10b2

2004-04-23  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	Added a -quality option to the quality_clip_reads option.

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	New template colour definition (-tmplcolour5) to match the
	spanning template status.

	* src/gap4/copy_db.c:
	Added a copy_read_name() function. This now handles duplicate
	readings by renaming them.

2004-04-23  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/notes.c:
	(10:38:24) Fixed a 1024 byte limitation on the RAWD note. 

2004-04-21  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl:
	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c,
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.h,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* src/gap4/template.c:
	* src/gap4/template_display.tcl:
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(13:29:51) Renamed the term 'template size strictness' to 'template
	size tolerance' to reflect the fact that larger numbers mean less
	strict. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(13:30:25) Added TEMPLATE_TOLERANCE as a configuration parameter so
	that users may adjust the default from 1.0. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(13:54:03) Changed the primer3 Tm settings back to their previous
	ranges. These are probably inappropriate for the PCR dialogue, but
	I'll tackle that later (with a different set of parameters
	perhaps). 

2004-04-20  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/clip.c:
	(16:23:35) Updated the quality_clip_ends function to output using
	vmessage() instead of printf. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(17:01:05) Added editor colour for spanning template 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h:
	(17:03:27) Added a new colour code and status for templates in the
	editor. "Spanning" templates now have the status "O" ("O"ther
	contig). Templates that are spanning and have only one end-read
	present are shown with a pink block. Currently spanning templates
	where both-ends are present and correct are still shown in the "Ok"
	colour, although the text code still lists "O". 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(17:03:28) Added a new colour code and status for templates in the
	editor. "Spanning" templates now have the status "O" ("O"ther
	contig). Templates that are spanning and have only one end-read
	present are shown with a pink block. Currently spanning templates
	where both-ends are present and correct are still shown in the "Ok"
	colour, although the text code still lists "O". 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.h:
	(17:03:29) Added a new colour code and status for templates in the
	editor. "Spanning" templates now have the status "O" ("O"ther
	contig). Templates that are spanning and have only one end-read
	present are shown with a pink block. Currently spanning templates
	where both-ends are present and correct are still shown in the "Ok"
	colour, although the text code still lists "O". 

2004-04-19  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/mk/alpha.mk:
	(11:24:56) Added F77_DEP so that gap4sh compiles. 

	* tables/checked.gif,
	* tables/unchecked.gif:
	(12:58:00) Added missing image files for the PCR primer picking
	code. 

	* src/gap4/pcr_primers.tcl:
	(12:58:26) Moved location of checked/unchecked gif images to
	$STADTABL. 

	* tables/Makefile:
	(12:59:20) Added *.gif to the list of extensions to copy using make
	dist. 

2004-04-16  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/restriction_enzymes.c:
	(16:15:34) The correct fragment size is now listed between mouse
	clicks in the plot. 

	* src/gap4/stop_codon.c:
	(16:16:22) Stop codons are now spotted when they contain pads
	within the codon. The reading frame no longer changes due to pads
	either. 

	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.c,
	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.h:
	(16:17:12) Added iubc_word_match_padded() for use with the depadded
	stop codon plot. 

	* src/seq_utils/renz_utils.c:
	(16:18:27) Added hash_seq4_padded() to hash on word length 4 in
	data containing pads. This was created for the gap4 stop-codon plot
	updates and it pretty much works OK, but in the end I decided not
	to use it. 

	* src/tk_utils/restriction_enzyme_map.c:
	(16:19:11) Added an unpadded_cut_site parameter to PlotStickMap.
	Required by the gap4 restriction enzyme plot changes. 

	* src/tk_utils/restriction_enzyme_map.h:
	(16:19:27) Added an unpadded_cut_site parameter to PlotStickMap.
	Required by the gap4 restriction enzyme plot changes. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkSheet_common.c,
	* src/tk_utils/tkSheet_struct.h:
	(16:21:22) Added a 'grid' member of the sheet widget to control
	whether Tk_SetGrid should be used. This allows us to only specify
	one widget to be controlling the grid within a toplevel (which is
	supposedly required by Tk, despite the fact that we've used 2
	within the contig editor for ages). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(16:24:00) Disabled "gridding" (resizing in steps quantised to the
	font size) within the editor and adjusted the Any-Configure event
	handler.
	
	This means that the editor can now display half a character, or
	that the vertical scrollbar grows/shrinks to fit in an exact number
	of characters.
	
	However it does cure some horrible resizing bugs when running on
	RedHat9 using metacity (I believe the problem is with metacity, not
	redhat9 or gap4) and generally resizing has been buggy for a long
	while. Hopefully this produces fewer problems than it solves. 

2004-04-14  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c (disassemble_readings): 
	Removed a database corruption caused when a reading is removed
	from the database (not just moved) and then no subsequent write of
	the main GT_Database record is performed.

2004-04-13  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(10:32:26) Updated comments regarding MMAP speed tests 

	* src/mutlib/Makefile:
	(10:42:55) CFLAGS vs CXXFLAGS name 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(10:43:29) Include <string.h> for Solaris C++ 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(10:44:44) Changed default filtering options 

	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	(10:47:19) Change to reflect local sanger ntemplates used (3 to 2). 

	* src/scripts/assemble4:
	(10:48:52) Remove -f in "stash -f" 

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl:
	(10:55:28) Added a template strictness option. This controls how
	far outside the min-max template size a template can be before
	being flagged as inconsistent 

	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c,
	* src/gap4/gap_globals.h,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(10:55:29) Added a template strictness option. This controls how
	far outside the min-max template size a template can be before
	being flagged as inconsistent 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(10:56:18) Menu items for the new template strictness function and
	the gap4 PCR interface. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	(10:57:31) Added definitions for gap4 PCR interface, changed the
	default primer picking parameters, added the colour for the
	"ends-not-present" template staus in the editor, and the 'do not
	show inconsistent templates' template display option. 

	* src/gap4/template_display.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.h,
	* src/gap4/template_display.tcl:
	(10:58:55) Added an option to turn off display of inconsistent
	templates. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.h:
	(11:00:54) A new template status code (E) and colour have been
	added. This shows when a template is consistent, but one or both
	"end sequences" are not present and so the position has not been
	experimentally verified. 

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	(11:01:35) Made raising of the search window option. The new
	bindings in contig_editor.tcl no longer raise the window when page
	up/down is used. 

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	(11:02:25) Initialise the GReadings structures and vseq_t
	structures. (Bug fix for uninitialised data.) 

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c:
	(11:02:34) Initialise the GReadings structures and vseq_t
	structures. (Bug fix for uninitialised data.) 

	* src/prefinish/finish_reverse.c:
	(11:02:35) Initialise the GReadings structures and vseq_t
	structures. (Bug fix for uninitialised data.) 

	* src/gap4/pcr_primers.tcl:
	(11:03:24) Gap4 GUI to the prefinish code to pick PCR primers
	between contig ends. Preliminary version. 

	* src/prefinish/Makefile,
	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_pcr.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_pcr.h:
	(11:04:32) Added interface to using primer3 for PCR picking;
	initially just between contig ends. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.h:
	(11:05:18) Generalised the filter functions to work on any sequence
	rather than hand-coded members of the finish_t structure. Used by
	the new PCR picking code. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_utils.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(11:05:45) Moved score_match2() from finish_walk.c to
	finish_utils.c and renamed to secondary_primer_match(). 

	* tables/NOTEDB:
	(11:06:28) Created a new note type FAKE. This is used in the
	prefinishing system to mark sequences that should not contribute to
	strand analysis (eg consensus sequences). 

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(11:06:29) Created a new note type FAKE. This is used in the
	prefinishing system to mark sequences that should not contribute to
	strand analysis (eg consensus sequences). 

	* src/tk_utils/help_choose.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/help_galeon.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/help_netscape.tcl:
	(11:07:19) Added more options for the web browser to use for online
	help. Konqueror, mozilla and galeon are now supported. 

2004-04-08  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/ng_fb_cmds.tcl:
	(10:17:11) Honour the no_csel command line option when opening new
	databases via File->Open 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(10:31:48) The default position for the main window when starting
	up gap4 with a database specified on the command line is now
	underneath the contig selector window. 

	* src/mk/linux.mk:
	(10:34:08) Changed gcc/g++/g77 names to exclude the version number
	(suggestion by Joe Burks). 

	* src/Misc/misc.h:
	(10:42:22) Surround getopt prototype with ifdef _MSC_VER. (Joe
	Burks) 

	* mklinks:
	(10:48:11) Added link in scripting_manual to ../manual/tools. Added
	explicit "." as the destination for ln as SGI ln does not accept
	this as a default. 

	* doc/manual/tools/make_ps:
	(10:53:32) Changed the default location of 'convert' program. We
	still specify the full path to avoid confusion with the staden
	package 'convert' tool. (idea from Joe Burks) 

	* doc/manual/tools/edit_mini_contents.pl:
	(10:54:14) Changed default location of perl to /usr/bin/perl (idea
	from Joe Burks) 

	* doc/manual/tools/html_index.pl,
	* doc/manual/tools/merge_indexes.pl,
	* doc/manual/tools/remove_xrefs.pl,
	* doc/manual/tools/texi2html,
	* doc/manual/tools/texi2man.pl,
	* doc/manual/tools/xref_update.pl:
	(10:54:15) Changed default location of perl to /usr/bin/perl (idea
	from Joe Burks) 

	* course/texi/Makefile:
	(14:35:25) Changed @tick{} and @cross{} macros for m4 _tick() and
	_cross() implementations. This avoids the need for makeinfo and
	hence also avoids problems with no .txt copies of images. 

	* course/texi/course.texi,
	* course/texi/exercise1.texi,
	* course/texi/header.m4:
	(14:35:26) Changed @tick{} and @cross{} macros for m4 _tick() and
	_cross() implementations. This avoids the need for makeinfo and
	hence also avoids problems with no .txt copies of images.

	* src/gap4/oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(11:30:47) Added a createTmpAnnotation function and a
	create_tmp_anno editor subcommand to utilise it. This is used for
	displaying fake annotations (eg it was previously done via C-only
	in the "suggest primers" option of the contig editor). 

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl:
	(11:33:18) Cosmetic changes to the "edit oligo parameters"
	dialogue. 

	* src/gap4/primlib.c,
	* src/gap4/primlib.h:
	(11:35:05) Added "num_return" as a configurable (from tcl) primlib
	parameter.
	
	Added primlib_choose_pcr function. 

2004-03-30  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/consen.c:
	(08:56:23) Allow ambiguity codes to be written to FASTA files. Not
	technically correct according to the original fasta spec, but no
	one seems to care about that these days. 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	(09:07:24) Moved a declaration to the start of a block (as it was
	an accidental C++ism). 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(09:08:28) Moved inexact_pad_match function to earlier in file to
	avoid missing prototype complaints. 

	* src/gap4/gap_utils.tcl:
	(09:09:15) Cosmetic formatting change. 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(09:10:03) Moved "int length" to start of block to avoid C++ism. 

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c:
	(09:11:50) Added _select_region function (which should have been
	checked in with the last round of editor updates). 

2004-03-22  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/html_library.tcl:
	(11:25:37) Removed the focus hack which broke when tk was updated
	to 8.4 (it gave rise to an infinite recursion). 

	* src/tk_utils/help_choose.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/tclIndex:
	(11:26:33) Changed how the help mechanism is chosen. 

	* src/pregap4/gui.tcl,
	* src/trev/trev.tcl:
	(11:27:53) Removed the 'beta' component of the program version
	number. 

	* ChangeLog:
	(11:35:15) *** empty log message *** 

2004-03-15  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(16:08:01) Added tcl interface to the list_base_confidence command. 

	* src/gap4/qualIO.c,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.h:
	(16:10:02) New functions for producing distributions of phred
	scores for bases that match and mismatch the consensus sequence.

	* src/gap4/qual.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(16:10:40) Tcl dialogue for the list base confidence command 

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(16:12:40) Added List Base Confidences to view menu. 

2004-03-12  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(12:00:13) Added an interface to editor_select_region. This marks
	(underlines) a selection, for visual view and for use with create
	tag etc. 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(12:01:27) Matches displayed in the editor are now automatically
	selected, for faster tagging.
	
	The search by tags mode now also matches in padded sequence. 

2004-03-11  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	(11:57:05) Fixed a buffer overflow (and general inefficiency) in
	calling the depadding code. 

2004-03-10  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(14:07:34) Added a consensus consistency quality array (in qual2)
	for the bayesian consensus algorithm. This is designed to indicate
	likely alignment conflicts. 

	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.c,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.h,
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(14:09:59) Added consensus discrepancy as a plot type in the
	"consistency display". This uses the new discrepancy part of the
	consensus algorithm. 

	* src/gap4/consistency_display.h:
	(14:10:56) Added consensus discrepancy as a plot type in the
	"consistency display". This uses the new discrepancy part of the
	consensus algorithm. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl,
	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c,
	* tables/gaprc:
	(14:12:48) New editor search mode: search by consensus discrepancy 

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	(14:13:25) Added consensus discrepancy as a plot type in the
	"consistency display". This uses the new discrepancy part of the
	consensus algorithm. 

	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(14:14:49) Exported InputSelectReadingList and added "Highlight
	reading list" on to the main Lists menu. 

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl:
	(14:16:48) Renamed "save" to "save order" to avoid confusion with
	saving the list itself to disk. 

2004-03-05  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(12:42:02) Added a new option to allow the highlight disagreements
	mode to be filtered by base quality. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(12:42:20) Added a new option to allow the highlight disagreements
	mode to be filtered by base quality. 

2004-03-04  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish.h,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(16:33:39) Added -no_filter and -no_consensus options for
	optimising picking of only resequences (where dust and consensus is
	not needed).
	
	Also moved the regexp #ifdef for processing the skip_templates and
	avail_templates files to be a run-time option (-regexp_templates). 

2004-03-03  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(14:54:03) Recent fix to open_db broke creation of new databases.
	Now check that the failure code from access() is EACCES and not
	ENOENT. 

	* src/mutlib/Makefile,
	* src/mutlib/align.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/array.hpp,
	* src/mutlib/caller.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/list.hpp,
	* src/mutlib/matrix.hpp,
	* src/mutlib/mutationtag.cpp,

	* src/mutlib/sp_matrix.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/stringlist.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/trace.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/trace.hpp,
	* src/mutlib/tracealign.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/tracealign_helper.cpp,
	* src/mutlib/tracediff.cpp:
	(17:02:25) Updates to work with "Compaq C++ V6.5-035".
	Specifically: Use <locale> instead of <cctype> for toupper. Use
	assert(pointer != NULL) instead of assert(pointer). 

	* src/mutscan/Makefile:
	(17:03:09) Added Tk to link line. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp,
	* src/mutscan/stringlist.cpp:
	(17:04:03) Use assert(pointer != NULL) instead of assert(pointer)
	to remove warnings from the Compaq C++ V6.5-035 compiler. 

	* src/tracediff/main.cpp:
	(17:04:24) Use assert(pointer != NULL) instead of assert(pointer)
	to remove warnings from the Compaq C++ V6.5-035 compiler. 

	* src/io_lib/ztr/ztr_translate.c:
	(17:45:52) Treat Read->basePos as 16-bit, which means hard-coding
	the first two bytes in ztr_encode_positions for each pos as zero. 

	* src/Misc/dstring.c:
	(17:46:48) "int" vs "size_t" so we can check the -1 return code
	from dstring_find(). 

	* src/g/g-request.c:
	(17:47:42) Remove compiler warning by using appropriate signness
	check in next_edtime(). 

	* src/gap4/IO2.h,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.c:
	(17:48:26) Corrected missing prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/clip.c:
	(17:48:54) Corrected missing prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.c:
	(17:51:04) The check for a tag type being known when picking the
	colour to draw (wrongly) always succeeded, but it chose the default
	colour anyway. Now the check has been removed, as the default
	colour is an appropriate method. (ie just a compiler warning
	removal.) 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(17:51:33) Version incr. 

	* src/gap4/io_utils.h:
	(17:52:35) Prevent compiler warnings caused by the gel_read macro
	always returning 0 (success), but being used in an "if
	(gel_read...)" context. Added a check for gelnum > 0 in order to
	provide a valid return code for the macro. 

	* src/gap4/join.c:
	(17:53:25) Fixed memory leak (not calling destroy_alignment_params)
	and reordered code slightly to remove an inconsequential compiler
	warning. 

	* src/mk/alpha.mk:
	(17:54:07) Changed default compilers to the Compaq cc/cxx/f77. 

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c:
	(17:55:41) Use system installed png.h instead of local hack. 

	* src/tk_utils/Attic/png.h:
	(17:56:28) Removed to allow system version to be picked up. 

2004-03-02  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	(17:26:01) Fix log files. Do not generate when the DB does not
	exist. Works better in read-only directories. 

2004-03-01  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/help_choose.tcl,
	* src/tk_utils/html_library.tcl:
	(10:30:28) The help_choose mechanism was broken due to having all
	the help_* files listed in the tclIndex. tcl-internal now also
	works too (removed the tkFocusOK function which was causing a
	auto-load loop as the official one is now ::tk::FocusOK; I do not
	think we needed the modified version anyway). 

	* src/tk_utils/tclIndex:
	(10:30:29) The help_choose mechanism was broken due to having all
	the help_* files listed in the tclIndex. tcl-internal now also
	works too (removed the tkFocusOK function which was causing a
	auto-load loop as the official one is now ::tk::FocusOK; I do not
	think we needed the modified version anyway). 

2004-02-27  jkbonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(16:56:01) On the first database write after a flush Gap4 will
	check the global time stamp in the Aux header to make sure that the
	disk copy matches it's own cached in-mory copy.
	
	The rationale behind this is that users still manually remove the
	BUSY file because "they know best". They then act all suprised when
	their database becomes corrupt. Our alternative here is to check
	the master time-stamp in the Aux header and to simply abort Gap4
	(losing all unsaved edits) if it has been changed external to this
	process.
	
	This still leaves room for race conditions (multiple people editing
	simultaenously), but it covers the more common case of a gap4
	session left open for ages and then going back to it later. 

	* src/g/g-files.h,
	* src/g/g-request.c,
	* src/g/g-struct.c,
	* src/g/g-struct.h:
	(16:56:02) On the first database write after a flush Gap4 will
	check the global time stamp in the Aux header to make sure that the
	disk copy matches it's own cached in-mory copy.

	session left open for ages and then going back to it later. 

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(16:57:45) Removed debugging message. 

2004-02-26  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/fij.tcl,
	* src/gap4/fij.c,
	* src/gap4/fij.h,
	* src/gap4/do_fij.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	Added an option to control the maximum alignment length displayed
	from find internal joins (in the text output window).

2004-02-24  James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap-error.c:
	(09:33:43) Changed bug email addr to sourceforge url 

	* src/gap4/clip.c,
	* src/gap4/clip.h,
	* src/gap4/clip.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(16:18:04) Added a "quality clip contig ends" function to trim back
	low quality data off the end of contigs. The purpose is to correct
	for phrap assemblies where clipping is typically done based on
	disagreements, and disagreements at the very end when depth=1 do
	not happen. This leads to 'rubbish' being at the contig end,
	devaluing the FIJ with "hidden data" turned off. 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(16:18:05) Added a "quality clip contig ends" function to trim back
	low quality data off the end of contigs. The purpose is to correct
	for phrap assemblies where clipping is typically done based on
	disagreements, and disagreements at the very end when depth=1 do
	not happen. This leads to 'rubbish' being at the contig end,
	devaluing the FIJ with "hidden data" turned off. 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(16:19:07) Allow trace display linewidth to be a configurable
	parameter. 

2004-02-20  James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c:
	(16:58:43) Fixed swapped reseq_nsolutions and long_nsolutions
	parameters. 

2004-02-19  James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c:
	(12:13:52) Fixed typo in LG qualifier (was LF). 

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.h:
	(13:48:59) More type fixes; EFLT_LG was given the same number as
	_FT. Now diff. 

2004-02-18  James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(10:23:31) Fixed a bug in the handling of DB_FLAG_INVIS and
	sequences being out of order due to clip-point adjustment. Hidden
	readings could be used for the consensus and unhidden would be
	skipped. It now uses _DBI_order() to resolve this. 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(11:18:54) Updated version number. 

	* src/tk_utils/Makefile:
	(11:25:06) Added an explicit "." to the ln commands as SGIs do not
	allow for default to the current directory. 

	* src/text_utils/Makefile:
	(11:25:59) Added an explicit "." to the ln commands as SGIs do not
	allow for default to the current directory. 

	* src/tracediff/Makefile:
	(11:50:09) Added an explicit "." to the ln commands as SGIs do not
	allow for default to the current directory. 

2004-02-16  James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.h:
	(15:32:40) Added GRL copyright notice 

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.h:
	(15:32:42) Added GRL copyright notice 

2004-02-13  James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	* ChangeLog:
	(09:18:33) Latest changelog summary, plus removal of email
	addresses. 

	* src/mk/global.mk:
	(09:22:54) Added TK_LIB to TEXTUTILS_LIB definition as on some
	systems the linker refuses to allow unresolved (but unused)
	symbols. 

2004-02-12  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	TAG CODEBASE with rel-1-4

2004-02-12  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/undo.c:
	(09:59:23) Fixed undo so that nested OpenUndo and CloseUndo work as
	expected (ie Undo undoes the outermost block and not the
	innermost). 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tagEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(10:00:48) Added tag editor "Move" and "Copy" buttons. These allow
	the tag position/length to be changed, from sequence to sequence,
	or even between contigs (between editors). 

	* LICENCE.txt:
	(10:27:00) Initial version

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(10:29:01) Added filtering for clusters of tags, as these are
	almost invariably due to broken alignments. 

	* src/Misc/dependencies,
	* src/abi/dependencies,
	* src/copy_reads/dependencies,
	* src/eba/dependencies,
	* src/find_renz/dependencies,

	* src/seq_utils/dependencies,
	* src/spin/dependencies,
	* src/stops/dependencies,
	* src/text_utils/dependencies:
	(10:32:01) Updated dependency files (from gmake depend)

2004-02-09  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.c,
	* src/io_lib/exp_file/expFileIO.h:
	(14:39:52) Added LG (LiGation) to experiment file definition. 

2004-02-05  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* gap4_production link updated (Sanger specific)

2004-02-03  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO2.c,
	* src/gap4/enter_tags.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h,
	* src/gap4/preass.c,
	* src/gap4/tagU2.c,
	* src/gap4/tagUtils.h:
	(09:43:30) add_tags and enter_tags now allow for tags to be input
	in unpadded coordinates. 

	* src/gap4/gap-dbstruct.h:
	(09:43:46) Fixed comment for Nfreerecs. 

	* src/copy_reads/copy_reads.c:
	(09:58:11) Updated call of create_tag_for_gel. 

2004-01-27  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(10:17:09) Remove duplicates from fofn before disassembling as they
	cause infinite loops. 

	* src/gap4/tk-io-reg.c:
	(16:43:48) Add the 'contig busy' dialog to the quit_displays
	function so that disassemble readings and break contig have more
	visible error conditions. 

2004-01-22  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(11:52:46) Changed the dependent_table[] to increment by 7
	initially instead of 8 so that the scores mirror the old version
	more closely. 

2004-01-21  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	(10:18:07) Commented out previous change to do with lockf on the
	database file. This is causing databases to claim they are locked
	when they are not. I believe this is due to problems with NFS lockd
	when machines crash and not getting an up to date cache of the lock
	status. 

	* src/g/g-files.c:
	(10:18:10) *** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/configure.tcl:
	(10:18:27) Dead code removal. 

	* src/gap4/qual.c:
	(10:19:53) David Harper spotted an inconsistency in the consensus
	calculation. When a pad is in a column depend_add[depth] is added
	per extra base (typically 8 per base, and then reducing bit by
	bit). When a pad is not in a column it adds 7*depth for all depth.
	
	The code now always uses the former array lookup method. 

	* src/tk_utils/config.tcl:
	(10:24:03) Updated font selector window. 

	* tables/tk_utilsrc:
	(10:24:50) Changed all unix font defs to use pixel sizes instead of
	point sizes. 

2004-01-14  The Badger Set [sc3]  <badger>

	* src/prefinish/Makefile,
	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA_ends_only:
	(10:29:14) Updated make install and added the ends_only config
	script. 

2004-01-14  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/user_defaults.tcl:
	(14:52:29) When loading up *rc files, source *rc.local too if it
	exists. This allows for easy installation of site-specific
	configurations. 

	* src/tk_utils/user_defaults.tcl:
	(14:54:26) Fixed a bug in the new .local code. 

	* src/seqed/Group.itcl,
	* src/seqed/checkedgetfname.itk,
	* src/seqed/dataentry.itk,
	* src/seqed/feature_editor.itk,

	* src/seqed/renzymebox.itk,
	* src/seqed/seq.gif,
	* src/seqed/texteditor.itk:
	(15:51:07) Missing files added 

2004-01-13  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	Gap4 version "4.9 test 3"
	
2004-01-13  Mark Griffiths  <mng>

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	(09:22:51) Fixed trace flash for trace display. 

2004-01-13  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/read/translate.c:
	(17:02:00) In read2exp only set the file format to be TT_EXP when
	'redirection to trace' is not enabled (ie it indicates where the
	sequence came from, EXP or SCF/ZTR/...). 

	* src/gap4/consen.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h,
	* src/gap4/consen.h,
	* src/gap4/consen.tcl,
	* tables/gaprc:
	(17:13:24) Save consensus now has the option to use the left-most
	template name instead of left-most reading name as the contig
	identifier. This is useful primarily for cDNA based projects. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	(17:14:48) Positions are now listed in the "goto..." menu from the
	editor names. 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	* src/g/g-files.c,
	(17:16:25) We now use lockf() on the database file itself (DB.V,
	not DB.V.aux), thus preventing corruptions causing by manually
	removing the BUSY file. 

	* src/tk_utils/misc.c,
	* lib/tk/xmfbox.tcl:
	(17:22:07) Updated the tk Motif-style filebrowser to be MUCH faster
	(x80) by using the dir_or_file command from tk_utils (which was
	reimplemented to use Tcl_Obj and take a list as the argument). 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(17:24:10) Removed blank -avail_template_file argument. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_hash.c:
	(17:25:49) Compare primer now checks for the sequence to hash being
	shorter than the hash word length, in order to avoid for hashing
	error messages. 

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(17:27:11) Update to version 4.9test3 

2004-01-12  Mark Griffiths  <mng>

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(11:17:20) fixed bell before raising dialog. 

2004-01-12  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	(10:35:03) Added a two-pass method to generate_experiments. Pick
	the most appropriate end for single-stranded experiments (as
	before), but if that fails we now work outwards from the other end
	too. This helps to pick experiments when our contig is covered
	entirely by a single-stranded region. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(10:35:44) We no longer rely on t_start1 and t_start2 when the
	template is inconsistent as the template positioning information
	may be invalid. Using min/max instead. 

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	(10:35:53) Updated version number. 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(11:47:45) Corrected guessing of template boundaries for
	"complemented" templates. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	(12:35:54) Apply a cost increase to experiments that do not connect
	to at least one end of the problem region.
	
	The reason being that a problem from 1-1000 with reading length 600
	can be solved in 2 experiments, but chosing the first experiment
	(due to minor reasons like better primer) from 200-800 requires 2
	extra experiments to solve it. 

2004-01-09  Mark Griffiths  <mng>

	* doc/manual/dependencies,
	* doc/manual/gap4-t.texi:
	(14:19:12) contig navigation help added. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex:
	(14:21:15) Added -nojoin to edit_contig command , returning path to
	window. Added editor_id_to_edstruct. 

	* tables/gaprc,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	(14:21:44) Added contig navigation menu to View menu. 

	* doc/manual/contig_navigation-t.texi,
	* doc/manual/contig_navigation_browse.unix.gif,
	* doc/manual/contig_navigation_table.unix.gif:
	(14:24:36) Contig navigation help files. 

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(14:25:21) Contig navigation interface. 

	* src/gap4/gap_nav.tcl:
	(15:53:06) Fixed next/previous bug and added error checks on
	contigs not found. 

2004-01-09  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* lib/Makefile:
	* lib/tablelist3.4/**
	(14:42:07) Upgraded tablelist to v3.4 

2003-12-18  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/text_output.c:
	(16:13:56) Include hostname in the log_file output 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(16:14:28) Fixed more tag corruptions from disassemble readings. 

2003-12-16 James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	TAG CODEBASE with rel-1-3
	Gap4 version "4.9 test 2"
	
2003-12-16  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	(16:54:09) Version incr. 

	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	(16:55:33) Improved error reporting of tag input. 

	* src/mutlib/array.hpp,
	* src/mutlib/caller_base.cpp:
	(16:56:27) Floating point error checking: divide by zero and
	log(0). 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(16:58:28) Remove checking of template consistency. 

	* src/tracediff/main.cpp:
	(16:59:15) Disable experiment file redirection so that the base
	positions are valid. 

2003-12-08  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* tables/gaprc_menu_full,
	* tables/gaprc:
	(12:06:48) Added new "group by" methods to the editor. In addition
	to the original "group by templates" we can group by strand, clone,
	name, number and position.
	
	Also fixed a bug in the "go to" function to jump to alternate reads
	on a template. After a join the cached contig number could be
	invalid, so the contig number is calculated on the fly. 

	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c:
	(12:08:00) Improved the align_blocks() function.
	
	(In some cases this caused the join editor "align" command to not
	work.) 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	(12:09:17) check_template_length_overlap() has been rewritten to
	more correctly figure out if a template is inconsistent between two
	contigs. It now checks for primer inconsistencies, eg where two
	forward readings exist, but not at the same position or in
	differing orientations. 

	* staden.profile:
	(12:11:00) Removed "bash"isms. 

	* src/mutscan/main.cpp:
	(12:13:16) Added a call to read_experiment_redirect(), otherwise
	some traces read had no original position information. Also
	reformatted to remove windows linefeeds. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	(12:13:38) Min template score is now 0.1 (instead of 0.3). 

2003-12-01 James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	TAG CODEBASE with rel-1-2
	Gap4 version "4.9 test 1"
	
2003-12-01 James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/IO.h,
	* src/gap4/IO3.c:
	(15:22:09) Code tidyup to remove unused fortran functions 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/tclIndex,
	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl:
	(15:23:08) Improved reading selection from within the editor. Added
	a "select all from right" option (and made it work snappily). 

	* src/gap4/break_contig.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c:
	(15:24:13) Fixed a tag corruption bug in disassemble readings
	whereby the annotation freelist could get joined onto the end of a
	contig list when duplicating tags (due to breaking a contig).
	
	Made tag duplication an option. 

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl,
	* src/gap4/gap.tcl,
	* tables/gaprc:
	(15:27:41) Added -no_csel and -csel options to control whether the
	contig selector starts automatically. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	(15:28:41) Fixed a bug in computation of the number of spanning
	templates; displayed when shutting down the join editor. 

	* src/gap4/preass.c:
	(15:29:06) Replaced used of old fortran functions with C versions. 

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.c,
	* src/gap4/template_display.h:
	(15:30:14) Moved update_reading_list function to edInterface.c 

2003-11-26 James Bonfield <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/break_contig.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.h,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.tcl,
	* src/gap4/legacy.f,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	(15:23:42) Fixed various disassemble readings bugs relating to
	annotations and splitting contigs. Whether to duplicate the
	annotations is now an option (although at present omitted from the
	GUI as it doesn't honour this flag in all cases).
	
	Break contig has also been rewritten to use disassemble readings as
	a basis for its operation.
	
	Finally, the fortran code for both disassemble readings and break
	contig has been ditched. 

	* src/gap4/IO3.c:
	(15:24:23) Fixed a bug in swap_read() (used by disassemble
	readings). It wasn't relinking the "prev" field of notes back to
	the newly renumbered sequence. 

	* src/gap4/copy_db.c:
	(15:24:51) Fixed a bug in merging the db.free_notes fields. 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.tcl:
	(18:01:44) Remove pads from sequence in "find sequence" function
	before doing the search. (It matches padded data fine anyway, so
	this just avoids the user having the depad their query sequence.) 

2003-11-19 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h,
	* src/prefinish/fake_insert_sizes.tcl:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	Added low_quality solution picking 

	* src/gap4/template.h:
	Fixed a bug in TEMP_DIRECTION macro where it returned direction -1
	for any error, rather than only on a TEMP_CONSIST_STRAND error. 

	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl:
	Load List has an option to specify a list to be a "Reading List".
	This then automatically tags it with SEQID to allow hyperlinks to
	work. 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	Removed debugging 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	When computing the template direction we now set this from the
	first contig in the list rather than the last. The first in the
	list will always be the first contig specified in
	init_template_checks, and so is the 'correct' contig for use within
	prefinish.
	
	The direction is also set to be the most frequent observed
	direction for that template, rather than ? when there is a
	conflict. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_reverse.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	When setting the template direction we no longer set it to ? when
	there is an inconsistency. This means that the template direction
	will be set to the most well represented direction (unless it is
	50/50 split in which case it is still ?). 

2003-11-17 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* tables/gaprc:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	Added ARC= and URL= RAWDATA search methods to fetch traces via the
	ensembl trace archive and via a URL. 

	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c:
	Added Tcl_ResultResult call to to get_name method. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Added a "clear list" option to the names widget. 

	* src/gap4/IO.h:
	Added prototype for IO.h 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	Include more prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	Minor comment changes 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	Moved checking of file format to after trace widget has loaded the
	file. This removes the need to load the trace twice (the first load
	was in determine_trace_type, now not used). 

	* src/gap4/alter_rel.c,
	* src/gap4/alter_rel.h,
	* src/gap4/alter_rel.tcl,
	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.h:
	Moved the remove_contig_holes from assemble_direct to dis_readings.
	Rewrote remove contig as a disassemble (for entire contig). Major
	overhaul of disassemble readings. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	New disassemble readings interface. 

	* src/seq_utils/align.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align.h:
	New function calignm(). Like calign(), but the alignment matrix
	(W128) is an argument. The default matrix is now case insensitive
	too. 

	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	Overhaul of split_contig_tags. 

	* src/gap4/legacy.f:
	Removed Fortran version of disassemble readings (now in C). 

	* src/mutlib/tracealign_interpolate.cpp:
	Removed a memory read-overflow. 

2003-11-14 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/tracediff/main.cpp:
	Converted cr/nl to nl.
	
	Fixed a bug in the printing of the tag positions. Positions
	presumably changed from being a single value to a pair - we just
	print the first element now. 

2003-11-13 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/IO2.c:
	Added code in stikit_ to set r.sense prior to calling
	io_write_seq(). The changes made a while back to io_write_seq() to
	update the in-memory io_length array caused the fortran code to
	break as it uses the sign of the length to set the orientation. 

2003-11-12 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/IO3.c:
	Protect against the template (subclone_id) in get_subclone_info
	from being zero and causing a crash. Only an issue for the old
	"suggest primers" function and gap2caf. 

2003-11-05 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	In the editor reading numbers now have +/- instead of <blank>/- to
	indicate strand. 

	* src/gap4/gap-error.c:
	Set email address to ask users to report bugs as
	syshelp 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/template.h,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	Spanning template status is displayed from the join editor when the
	quit button is pressed. 

2003-11-04 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	Add template-end tolerance code to more locations to allow for
	missing vector at the end of primer-walks. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	Added in the colours of template status within the editor. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/dependencies,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl,
	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.h:
	Added template status analysis into the contig editor names
	display.
	
	The right-click menu now allows a "goto" option to jump to other
	members of that template.
	
	The menu also allows (de)selection of a single reading or
	(de)selection of all readings on that template. 

	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c:
	Default "chem_as_double" is now 0 (off) 

2003-10-27 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c,
	* tables/gaprc:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.h,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	Added the ability to search by sequence within the readings as well
	as the consensus. 

	* src/gap4/contig_id.tcl:
	Bugfix to selection changes when using a "range" contig_id 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	Fixed out by one error. 

2003-10-24 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c:
	Added a -fofn option 

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl:
	Added a GC_Clamp option to the oligo selection dialogue, and
	remember the users inputs for some other bits. 

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	Added a baseline (-b) option to remove background. 

	* src/gap4/tagU1.c:
	Added protection for a defined, but empty, GTAGDB environment
	variable. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/qual.h,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.c,
	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	Extended the database_info (and similar) callback functions to take
	new job types for insertion and deletion into sequences. This is
	currently only used by the new experimental shuffle pads option. 

	* src/gap4/IO.c,
	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	Improved log file handling to write out the username opening the
	database and a message when the lock file is overridden. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	More error checking on writing compressed files. 

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	Protect against the base spacing being listed as a negative number
	in the ABI file. 

	* src/mk/alpha.mk:
	Removed -rpath support as it causes more problems than it cures. 

	* src/gap4/contig_id.tcl,
	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	The contig identifier box and the 'value' component in the editor
	search boxes are now automatically selected and focused, meaning
	that users can simply type over the previous value. 

2003-10-23 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c,
	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c,
	* src/gap4/hash_lib.h:
	Fixed a bug in Find Internal Joins where it failed to spot some
	matches. 

2003-10-22 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Added hyperlinks to the disassemble and 'set active list' lists
	created from the editor. 

2003-10-16  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish.[ch], src/prefinish/finish_utils.[ch]:
	Added an svec_as_cvec flag to allow SVEC tags to be treated as the
	clone end. This is useful for finishing EST sequences with one EST
	per contig.

2003-10-02 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c:
	Contig holes left after a disassembly are now stripped out, fixing
	db inconsistencies. This function will also be useful for the
	disassemble readings rewrite. 

2003-10-01 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	Ensure that io_length() memory cache is kept up to date when
	io_write_seq modifies it. 

	* src/prefinish/fake_insert_sizes.tcl,
	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA,
	* src/prefinish/svec2cvec.tcl:
	New scripts for interfacing with the chickenEST project and the new
	finish_me3 perl script. 

	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c:
	Set upper limit on the size of set_band_blocks to 5000 so that
	really long alignments do not consume too much memory. 

	* src/g/freetree.c:
	When we have a tr->largest block long enough to hold the requested
	length, we were returning NULL (due to broken code ordering)
	instead of returning the block. This causes the database to
	unnecessarily grow! 

2003-09-04 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	When searching for a solution on the bottom strand, set the
	position to solve as the right hand end of this problem. Likewise
	for the top strand (which is true by default). 

2003-09-02 James Bonfield (jkb)

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	Fixed default value of pwalk_nsolutions from 400 (a cut and paste
	error) to 1. Luckily finish.tcl specified this explicitly. 

2003-08-07  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.c:
	Used (unsigned char) cast instead of (unsigned) for index to
	complementary base etc, otherwise it will cast to unsigned int and
	use a massive offset (4 billion or so) for 'negative' characters.

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl (select_oligos):
	Made GC Clamp parameter configurable.
	Remember the search ahead/back and seq length parameters for the
	duration of the gap4 session.

2003-08-06  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	Prevent the SPAC (average spacing) in abi files from being
	negative. How does this happen?
	Also disabled the base reordering code as I believe this is not
	the correct thing to do.

2003-08-05  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* lib/prefinish/finish.[ch]: 
	We now search for fake templates (func skip_fake_templates) based
	on looking for sequences without trace files. This is in addition
	to the usual skip_templates file and provides an easy automatic
	way of filtering out imported consensus sequences and the like.

	* src/g/freetree.c (tree_find_len):
	When we have a tr->largest block long enough to hold the requested
	length, we were returning NULL (due to broken code ordering)
	instead of returning the block. This causes the database to
	unnecessarily grow!

	* src/ftp/tk8.4.0/unix/tkUnixFont.c (Tk_DrawChars):
	Reverted the (my) patch to query the window size for optimising
	text printing, as the XGetGeometry call requires a round-trip
	message to the X server and hence gives very slow lag for remote
	connections.

2003-08-04  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c: 
	Check for errors in fcompress_file. If the file created was fopened
	using wb and not wb+ and fwrite_reading is used, then
	fcompress_file will fail as the process cannot read back the file
	it wrote.

2003-07-30  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* gap4_production link updated.

2003-07-23  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/stops/stops.c: Fixed a bug in peak height clipping in the
	first 50 or so bases are all just noise (no signal). We now fill
	out peaks with non-clipped data and do height clipping after
	finding the best average region.

	* src/stops/stops.c: Added a baseline parameter to add a fixed
	amount to all peaks. This 'small sample correction' is used for
	preventing artificially good results when looking at very low
	scores.

2003-07-17  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c, src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	Added -reseq_nsolutions, -long_nsolutions and -pwalk_nsolutions
	as configuration parameters.

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c: (implement_solutions):
	Added a notion of a result type having a desired number of
	solutions to use. This is distinct from the number of items in a
	group. Eg we may want to pick 2 primers, and use 3 templates for
	each. The main purpose for this though is for picking more than 1
	resequence experiment for each problem.

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c (experiment_reseq):
	Fixed a bug in the use of strand vs sense. We now check sense for
	resequencing experiments as it doesn't matter if it's fwd or
	reverse sequence, just that it heads in the right direction.

2003-07-16  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c (score_experiments):
	Improved the score of experiments that have large groups. Eg more
	templates for a primer-walk are better than one.

	* src/gap4/extract.c (extract_readings): 
	The sort_readings function now returns an allocated structure
	holding the anchor read. This is used for replacing next_AP_left,
	which was VERY slow compared to the new method.

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c (assemble_direct):
	Directed assembly now ignores SL/SR lines when working out the
	left and right clip points, as this breaks copying data with
	extract readings. FIXME: this should be made optional.

2003-07-15  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl: Gap4 now 8.4b4.

2003-07-14  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c:
	Added code to display signed values from trace files.

2003-07-10  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/tk_utils/restriction_enzyme_map.c (plot_renz_matches):
	Corrected plotting to use padded_cut_site instead of cut_site.

	* src/seq_utils/renz_utils.h, src/gap4/restriction_enzymes.c:
	Added a 'padded_cut_site' element to the R_Match structure. This
	is used by gap4's restriction enzyme displays to store the padded
	positions, which are needed for plotting and cursor control. The
	original unpadded value is left in R_Match->cut_site and hence the
	text outputs of fragment sizes and positions are correct.

2003-07-07  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	Added support for reading phred-style confidence values from the
	ABI file.

2003-07-03  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.[ch], src/prefinish/finish.[ch],
	src/prefinish/finish_walk.c, src/prefinish/finish_main.c: 
	Added the filter_words algorithm into prefinish so that poly-A,
	GT-rich, etc can be filtered on. These are now also defined
	classification types and we check for different characters other
	than '#' in the finish_walk algorithms too.
	
2003-07-02  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	Output now includes the sequence preceeding the stop.
	Can now specify a directory name instead of files and the code
	iterates through the directory looking for SCF, ZTR and ABI files.

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c (DrawCSTags):
	Fixed a buffer overflow in creating the canvas item 'tag' list.

2003-07-01  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	check_template_position() was resetting the consistency value to
	zero, which overwrites the CONSIST_STRAND flags. Deleted this.

2003-07-01  Rodger Staden  <rs@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk>

	* src/qclip/qclip.c (main):
	Set the maximum right hand quality clip to 10 million, as it was
	only 10K meaning reference/consensus sequences could be truncated.

2003-06-27  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c (DBgetTags): 
	Call DBgetSeq from DBgetTags to ensure the sequence info has been
	loaded; specifically sequence length. This is needed as DBgetTags
	does tag validity checking. Normally the sequence is loaded before
	the tags, but at startup the other way around can now occur due to
	the new multi-tag-under-cursor changes.
	
	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c (save_trace_images):
	Corrected mutation report generation when the mini-traces are shown.

2003-06-26  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/tman_diff.c (diff_readings):
	When a trace isn't there to diff against, we now create a blank
	Read instead of returning NULL. This fixes a bug of missing
	difference traces causing the mutation report to fail.

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c (drawable_to_png):
	Better error handling. If png_create_write_struct failed it
	crashed trying to free png_ptr.

	* src/gap4/edMutations.c (sort_mutations):
	Remove buffer overflow. (Index using 1-N on an array alloc of N.)

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c (edDoSearch):
	Searching could miss hits (eg tags, and probably many other
	things) when Group Readings by Templates was enabled.

2003-06-25  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c (showCursor, onScreen):
	Scrolling down sequences when the Y-depth was too high would
	position the cursor on a sequence underneath the consensus line
	without Y scrolling the editor window properly.

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl (EditCSTagDetails),
	src/gap4/contig_selector.c (DrawCSTags):
	New function with a binding "Edit contig at tag pos" menu. Right
	clicking in a tag in the contig selector now allows the editor to
	be brought up at that position.

2003-06-24  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Set -tearoffs 0 on cascading edit tag and delete tag menus.

	* distrib/unix-S1_1b/tables/gaprc:
	Adjusted a few defaults to match the Sanger defaults (where
	appropriate globally). We still need to maintain a sanger diff
	though for definite-local changes (such as huge fonts and
	'hotpink' highlight colours).

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	Tweak the default parameters to use a longer window length and
	fixed a bug in identifying stops to skip.

	* src/prefinish/add_stops.tcl:
	New script to parse the 'stops' program output and add gap4 STOP
	tags.

2003-06-20  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c(find_primers):
	When generating consensus for primer3 we now check the
	dust-filtering so as not to pick primers from low complexity
	sequence. These were filtered out later, but it's faster to prefilter.
	
	* src/prefinish/dust.c, src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	Tweaks the dust window from 64 to 48 and adjusted the dust score
	accordingly.

	* src/prefinish/finish.c, src/prefinish/finish_main.[ch]:
	Added code to keep track of when a 'virtual sequence' overlaps
	another virtual sequence. If more than 2/3rds of it does then we
	start applying a penalty. This is designed to filter out the cases
	where repeating a primer-walk just a few bases further along
	solves a few more bases.

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl
	Reenabled the "after 1000" Any-Configure binding for the editor as
	it seemed to necessary to prevent flickering on the Neon systems.

2003-06-19  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c(link_vrseq): 
	For creation of new virtual sequences from the consensus we now
	change consensus '-' characters into 'A'. This is with the
	assumption that the new sequence will not be undetermined at that
	point (but obviously it may not be A). The reason for this is to
	fix the consensus confidence, otherwise it'd remain at 1 (like all
	'-'s).

	* src/stops/*:
	First version of the 'stop' detector. At present it just outputs the 
	info to stdout. 

	* src/gap4/clip.[ch], src/gap4/clip.tcl, src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	src/gap4/tclIndex, tables/gaprc, tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	Added a clip sequence by %age of non-ACGT (labelled N-clip). This
	solves a phrap alignment bug.

	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	Fixed a bug with loading tag macros from .gaprc.

2003-06-16  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl (trace_flash): 
	Replace the trace-flash window to cover the whole height of the
	trace instead of +40 onwards. (+40 was inappropriate after we
	moved the base calls from the top to the bottom of the trace.)
	
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Added 'break' to F1-F10 bindings so that the global keyboard menu
	traversal bindings do trigger.

2003-06-11  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c, src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	src/gap4/oligo.c, src/gap4/tagEditor.c, src/gap4/tagU1.c,
	src/gap4/tagUtils.h, src/gap4/tkEditor.c, tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	The Edit Tag and Delete tag editor commands are now cascading
	menus containing the list of all tags underneath the editing
	cursor. These lists are updated even if the menus have been torn
	off and after undo, etc.

2003-06-09  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full, tables/gaprc,
	src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Added an option to the Edit Modes menu to turn off fast tag
	deletion using F12 as this could be considered a dangerous option
	to allow by default.

2003-06-06  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c: set to version 1.19

	* src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	Changed the optimisation on solving low consensus confidence
	problems; we now always check both strands. Slower, but better in
	some cases (and never worse).

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	Fixed setting classify bit CONTIG_LEFT_END and CONTIG_RIGHT_END so
	that the 'problem' is cleared when a sequence extends the contig.

	Added code to correctly score sequences that extend the contig (if
	extending is required) even though the problem being solved may
	not be the contig-extend problem.

	Added a +50% score bonus to any experiment that also solves all
	mandatory problems +/- 100 bases around the sequence. This gives
	an encouragement to not leave tiny problems which require another
	experiment.

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	Rewrote the near_low_complexity() function. We are now allowed to
	use primers that are near a low complexity sequence provided the
	sequence extends though it and into at least opts.pwalk_seq_gap
	bases of non-low-complexity sequence.

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Changed F11/F12 and Shift-F11/F12 to edit/delete tag for faster
	tag work.

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl, tables/gaprc:
	Remember the editor Search window settings as the default for new
	editors, so that we do not need to keep changing the dialogue.

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (ListContigsRepopulate): 
	Reset the yview after processing a REG_LENGTH or REG_JOIN_TO event
	so that the contig list stays scrolled to the same point.

2003-06-04  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* tables/gaprc:
	Added PRIMER.max_end_stability (=9) definition and adjusted the
	PRIMER.self_any definition from 4 to 5.

	* src/gap4/primlib.[ch]:
	Added max_end_stability as a configurable option to send to
	Primer3.

	* src/prefinish/finish.c, src/prefinish/finish.tcl,
	src/prefinish/param_primer3.itcl:
	Added support for specifying self_any, self_end, gc_clamp,
	max_poly_x, and max_end_stability primer3 options to the prefinish
	code and we now set these values in the example finish.tcl file.

2003-06-03  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (InitListContigs,
	ListContigsSelectPressBindng):
	Added a binding to update the global contig-identifier (and hence
	update open dialogue boxes) when clicking on a contig in the List
	Contigs box.

2003-05-30  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/dbcheck.c (check_readings):
	We now check that all sequence contains printable characters. This
	is an attempt to spot the source of the nul characters appearing
	in some sequences, although check database is now some 25% slower.

	* src/tk_utils/container.c (container_scroll_x, container_scroll_y): 
	Added a check for when get_container returns NULL (which it was
	doing due to being called incorrectly via the name-clash listed
	below).
	
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl:
	* src/gap4/template_display.tcl:
	* src/gap4/gap_canvas_box.tcl:
	* src/gap4/gap_restriction_enzymes.tcl:
	* src/gap4/quality_plot.tcl:
	* src/gap4/stop_codon.tcl:
	* src/gap4/consistency_display.tcl:
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl:
	* src/gap4/reading_coverage.tcl:
	* src/gap4/readpair_coverage.tcl:
	* src/gap4/strand_coverage.tcl:
	Renamed scroll_x to gc_scroll_x, scroll_y to gc_scroll_y and
	get_next_row to c_get_next_row.
	This is to avoid name clashes with Kathryn's new spin2 container
	code in tk_utils (it seemed easier to rename the bits that I
	vaguely understand!).

2003-05-29  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c (edSelectOligoGenerate):
	src/gap4/primlib.c (primlib_choose): 
	Fixed error handling when no primers are found; to solve a memory
	corruption and a crash.

	* tables/gaprc:
	Adjusted primer3 settings for self_any, opt_length, gc_clamp and
	max_poly_x.

	* src/gap4/primlib.[ch]:
	Added gc_clamp and max_poly_x, as a cofigurable parameter.
	Corrected parsing in primlib_str2args such that when the last
	parameter has a 1-character value it is still
	processed. (Previously it was just silently skipped.)

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c (trace_init_pos): 
	Corrected the generation of blank trace arrays for EXP or PLN
	format sequences. We allocate the correct size traceA/C/G/T arrays
	and zero them. Without this change double clicking on a sequence
	in the editor whose trace is listed as an Experiment File that
	does not contain a LN line would cause a crash.

	* trace_display.tcl (trace_add): 
	Allow EXP files to be used for traces so that we can view traces
	via the LN/LT redirection.

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c (edSetCursor): 
	Corrected setting of xx->cursorSeq when the Y scrollbar is in use
	and the user clicks on the consensus. (This now means that all
	traces can be brought up again in such situations by double
	clicking on the consensus.)

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c (positionCursor): 
	Due to switching the sequence to be at the bottom of the trace
	instead of the top the editing cursor in the editor was invisible
	(underneath the first line of trace) when embedded traces were in
	use. Now fixed

2003-05-27  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/rules/extend_left.rule,
	src/prefinish/rules/extend_right.rule:
	In the GUI prefinish configurator, we set the default strand for
	left and right contig extensions to be bottom and top
	respectively. Previously these were back to front resulting in
	pointless experiments!

	* src/gap4/tag_checklist.tcl (TagDialog_default):
	The "As Default" command now saves to the users .gaprc file too.

	* src/gap4/tag_checklist.tcl (tag_checklist):
	Select All and Clear All buttons are back (and where missing due
	to a typo).
	

2003-05-23  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c (tcl_save_contig_order),
	  src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (ListContigsSave):
	Added a save_contig_order Tcl/C command to write a new contig
	order (for all contigs). The "List Contigs" window now has a Save
	button which uses this to save the currently sorted order.

	* src/gap4/oligo.c (display_oligo_details):
	Added code to print the oligo details to the editor information
	line as well as to the Text Output window.

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl (seloli_doit): Delete the code to blank the
	status line when bringing up the first primer after a manual (in
	editor) primer search.

2003-05-22  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/prefinish/finish_hash.c (hash_compare_primer): 
	Fix 'end' argument passed to false_priming. For bottom strand
	primers it was mixing up 5' and 3' ends and adding weight to the
	wrong one. Also minor debugging output changes.

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c: Changed the cost multiplier for
	primer secondary matches to be 1+pscore/100 instead of
	1+pscore/20, as the score doesn't seem to have a significant
	impact.

	* src/prefinish/tooltips.tcl (popup): Check for existance of a
	tooltip window and destroy it first if it exists. This fixes Tk
	errors (caused by rapid generation of events?).

2003-05-20  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* lib/tk/text.tcl (::tk::TextScanDrag): Allow 1 pixel of movement
	before switching to scan mode and setting mouseMoved flag. The
	mouseMoved flag disables pasting, and hence forceful middle
	clicking sometimes failed to paste.

2003-05-19  James Bonfield  <jkbonfield>

	* src/gap4/join.c (align, alignOverlap): 
	Alignments now depad the sequence before using Rodger's alignment
	code. To deal with repadding I used the old code and converted the
	output from Rodger's algorithm to be compatible with the Myers and
	Miller style of output.
	Also fixed a display shift after aligning.
