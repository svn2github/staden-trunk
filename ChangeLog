	* src/prefinish/finish.c: set to version 1.19

	* src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	Changed the optimisation on solving low consensus confidence
	problems; we now always check both strands. Slower, but better in
	some cases (and never worse).

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	Fixed setting classify bit CONTIG_LEFT_END and CONTIG_RIGHT_END so
	that the 'problem' is cleared when a sequence extends the contig.

	Added code to correctly score sequences that extend the contig (if
	extending is required) even though the problem being solved may
	not be the contig-extend problem.

	Added a +50% score bonus to any experiment that also solves all
	mandatory problems +/- 100 bases around the sequence. This gives
	an encouragement to not leave tiny problems which require another
	experiment.

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	Rewrote the near_low_complexity() function. We are now allowed to
	use primers that are near a low complexity sequence provided the
	sequence extends though it and into at least opts.pwalk_seq_gap
	bases of non-low-complexity sequence.

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Changed F11/F12 and Shift-F11/F12 to edit/delete tag for faster
	tag work.

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl, tables/gaprc:
	Remember the editor Search window settings as the default for new
	editors, so that we do not need to keep changing the dialogue.

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (ListContigsRepopulate): 
	Reset the yview after processing a REG_LENGTH or REG_JOIN_TO event
	so that the contig list stays scrolled to the same point.

2003-06-04  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* tables/gaprc:
	Added PRIMER.max_end_stability (=9) definition and adjusted the
	PRIMER.self_any definition from 4 to 5.

	* src/gap4/primlib.[ch]:
	Added max_end_stability as a configurable option to send to
	Primer3.

	* src/prefinish/finish.c, src/prefinish/finish.tcl,
	src/prefinish/param_primer3.itcl:
	Added support for specifying self_any, self_end, gc_clamp,
	max_poly_x, and max_end_stability primer3 options to the prefinish
	code and we now set these values in the example finish.tcl file.

2003-06-03  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (InitListContigs,
	ListContigsSelectPressBindng):
	Added a binding to update the global contig-identifier (and hence
	update open dialogue boxes) when clicking on a contig in the List
	Contigs box.

2003-05-30  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/dbcheck.c (check_readings):
	We now check that all sequence contains printable characters. This
	is an attempt to spot the source of the nul characters appearing
	in some sequences, although check database is now some 25% slower.

	* src/tk_utils/container.c (container_scroll_x, container_scroll_y): 
	Added a check for when get_container returns NULL (which it was
	doing due to being called incorrectly via the name-clash listed
	below).
	
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl:
	* src/gap4/template_display.tcl:
	* src/gap4/gap_canvas_box.tcl:
	* src/gap4/gap_restriction_enzymes.tcl:
	* src/gap4/quality_plot.tcl:
	* src/gap4/stop_codon.tcl:
	* src/gap4/consistency_display.tcl:
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl:
	* src/gap4/reading_coverage.tcl:
	* src/gap4/readpair_coverage.tcl:
	* src/gap4/strand_coverage.tcl:
	Renamed scroll_x to gc_scroll_x, scroll_y to gc_scroll_y and
	get_next_row to c_get_next_row.
	This is to avoid name clashes with Kathryn's new spin2 container
	code in tk_utils (it seemed easier to rename the bits that I
	vaguely understand!).

2003-05-29  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c (edSelectOligoGenerate):
	src/gap4/primlib.c (primlib_choose): 
	Fixed error handling when no primers are found; to solve a memory
	corruption and a crash.

	* tables/gaprc:
	Adjusted primer3 settings for self_any, opt_length, gc_clamp and
	max_poly_x.

	* src/gap4/primlib.[ch]:
	Added gc_clamp and max_poly_x, as a cofigurable parameter.
	Corrected parsing in primlib_str2args such that when the last
	parameter has a 1-character value it is still
	processed. (Previously it was just silently skipped.)

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c (trace_init_pos): 
	Corrected the generation of blank trace arrays for EXP or PLN
	format sequences. We allocate the correct size traceA/C/G/T arrays
	and zero them. Without this change double clicking on a sequence
	in the editor whose trace is listed as an Experiment File that
	does not contain a LN line would cause a crash.

	* trace_display.tcl (trace_add): 
	Allow EXP files to be used for traces so that we can view traces
	via the LN/LT redirection.

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c (edSetCursor): 
	Corrected setting of xx->cursorSeq when the Y scrollbar is in use
	and the user clicks on the consensus. (This now means that all
	traces can be brought up again in such situations by double
	clicking on the consensus.)

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c (positionCursor): 
	Due to switching the sequence to be at the bottom of the trace
	instead of the top the editing cursor in the editor was invisible
	(underneath the first line of trace) when embedded traces were in
	use. Now fixed

2003-05-27  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/rules/extend_left.rule,
	src/prefinish/rules/extend_right.rule:
	In the GUI prefinish configurator, we set the default strand for
	left and right contig extensions to be bottom and top
	respectively. Previously these were back to front resulting in
	pointless experiments!

	* src/gap4/tag_checklist.tcl (TagDialog_default):
	The "As Default" command now saves to the users .gaprc file too.

	* src/gap4/tag_checklist.tcl (tag_checklist):
	Select All and Clear All buttons are back (and where missing due
	to a typo).
	

2003-05-23  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c (tcl_save_contig_order),
	  src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (ListContigsSave):
	Added a save_contig_order Tcl/C command to write a new contig
	order (for all contigs). The "List Contigs" window now has a Save
	button which uses this to save the currently sorted order.

	* src/gap4/oligo.c (display_oligo_details):
	Added code to print the oligo details to the editor information
	line as well as to the Text Output window.

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl (seloli_doit): Delete the code to blank the
	status line when bringing up the first primer after a manual (in
	editor) primer search.

2003-05-22  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/finish_hash.c (hash_compare_primer): 
	Fix 'end' argument passed to false_priming. For bottom strand
	primers it was mixing up 5' and 3' ends and adding weight to the
	wrong one. Also minor debugging output changes.

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c: Changed the cost multiplier for
	primer secondary matches to be 1+pscore/100 instead of
	1+pscore/20, as the score doesn't seem to have a significant
	impact.

	* src/prefinish/tooltips.tcl (popup): Check for existance of a
	tooltip window and destroy it first if it exists. This fixes Tk
	errors (caused by rapid generation of events?).

2003-05-20  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* lib/tk/text.tcl (::tk::TextScanDrag): Allow 1 pixel of movement
	before switching to scan mode and setting mouseMoved flag. The
	mouseMoved flag disables pasting, and hence forceful middle
	clickig sometimes failed to paste.

2003-05-19  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/join.c (align, alignOverlap): 
	Alignments now depad the sequence before using Rodger's alignment
	code. To deal with repadding I used the old code and converted the
	output from Rodger's algorithm to be compatible with the Myers and
	Miller style of output.
	Also fixed a display shift after aligning.
