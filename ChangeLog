2003-11-19 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h,
	* src/prefinish/fake_insert_sizes.tcl:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA:
	Added low_quality solution picking 

	* src/gap4/template.h:
	Fixed a bug in TEMP_DIRECTION macro where it returned direction -1
	for any error, rather than only on a TEMP_CONSIST_STRAND error. 

	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl:
	Load List has an option to specify a list to be a "Reading List".
	This then automatically tags it with SEQID to allow hyperlinks to
	work. 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	Removed debugging 

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	When computing the template direction we now set this from the
	first contig in the list rather than the last. The first in the
	list will always be the first contig specified in
	init_template_checks, and so is the 'correct' contig for use within
	prefinish.
	
	The direction is also set to be the most frequent observed
	direction for that template, rather than ? when there is a
	conflict. 

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_reverse.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	When setting the template direction we no longer set it to ? when
	there is an inconsistency. This means that the template direction
	will be set to the most well represented direction (unless it is
	50/50 split in which case it is still ?). 

2003-11-17 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* tables/gaprc:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/utils/open_trace_file.c:
	Added ARC= and URL= RAWDATA search methods to fetch traces via the
	ensembl trace archive and via a URL. 

	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c:
	Added Tcl_ResultResult call to to get_name method. 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Added a "clear list" option to the names widget. 

	* src/gap4/IO.h:
	Added prototype for IO.h 

	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	Include more prototypes. 

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	Minor comment changes 

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl:
	Moved checking of file format to after trace widget has loaded the
	file. This removes the need to load the trace twice (the first load
	was in determine_trace_type, now not used). 

	* src/gap4/alter_rel.c,
	* src/gap4/alter_rel.h,
	* src/gap4/alter_rel.tcl,
	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.c,
	* src/gap4/dis_readings.h:
	Moved the remove_contig_holes from assemble_direct to dis_readings.
	Rewrote remove contig as a disassemble (for entire contig). Major
	overhaul of disassemble readings. 

	* src/gap4/dis_readings.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c:
	New disassemble readings interface. 

	* src/seq_utils/align.c,
	* src/seq_utils/align.h:
	New function calignm(). Like calign(), but the alignment matrix
	(W128) is an argument. The default matrix is now case insensitive
	too. 

	* src/gap4/tagU2.c:
	Overhaul of split_contig_tags. 

	* src/gap4/legacy.f:
	Removed Fortran version of disassemble readings (now in C). 

	* src/mutlib/tracealign_interpolate.cpp:
	Removed a memory read-overflow. 

2003-11-14 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/tracediff/main.cpp:
	Converted cr/nl to nl.
	
	Fixed a bug in the printing of the tag positions. Positions
	presumably changed from being a single value to a pair - we just
	print the first element now. 

2003-11-13 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/IO2.c:
	Added code in stikit_ to set r.sense prior to calling
	io_write_seq(). The changes made a while back to io_write_seq() to
	update the in-memory io_length array caused the fortran code to
	break as it uses the sign of the length to set the orientation. 

2003-11-12 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/IO3.c:
	Protect against the template (subclone_id) in get_subclone_info
	from being zero and causing a crash. Only an issue for the old
	"suggest primers" function and gap2caf. 

2003-11-05 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c:
	In the editor reading numbers now have +/- instead of <blank>/- to
	indicate strand. 

	* src/gap4/gap-error.c:
	Set email address to ask users to report bugs as
	syshelp@sanger.ac.uk 

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/template.c,
	* src/gap4/template.h,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c:
	Spanning template status is displayed from the join editor when the
	quit button is pressed. 

2003-11-04 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	Add template-end tolerance code to more locations to allow for
	missing vector at the end of primer-walks. 

	* tables/gaprc:
	Added in the colours of template status within the editor. 

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	* src/gap4/dependencies,
	* src/gap4/edInterface.c,
	* src/gap4/edStructs.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils.h,
	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/list_proc.tcl,
	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl,
	* src/gap4/tkEdNames.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.c,
	* src/gap4/tkEditor.h:
	Added template status analysis into the contig editor names
	display.
	
	The right-click menu now allows a "goto" option to jump to other
	members of that template.
	
	The menu also allows (de)selection of a single reading or
	(de)selection of all readings on that template. 

	* src/gap4/gap_globals.c:
	Default "chem_as_double" is now 0 (off) 

2003-10-27 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c,
	* tables/gaprc:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.h,
	* src/gap4/find_oligo.tcl,
	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	* src/gap4/newgap_structs.h:
	Added the ability to search by sequence within the readings as well
	as the consensus. 

	* src/gap4/contig_id.tcl:
	Bugfix to selection changes when using a "range" contig_id 

	* src/gap4/find_oligo.c:
	Fixed out by one error. 

2003-10-24 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/io_lib/progs/extract_seq.c:
	Added a -fofn option 

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl:
	Added a GC_Clamp option to the oligo selection dialogue, and
	remember the users inputs for some other bits. 

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	Added a baseline (-b) option to remove background. 

	* src/gap4/tagU1.c:
	Added protection for a defined, but empty, GTAGDB environment
	variable. 

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c,
	* src/gap4/qual.h,
	* src/gap4/qualIO.c,
	* src/gap4/vseqs.c:
	Extended the database_info (and similar) callback functions to take
	new job types for insertion and deletion into sequences. This is
	currently only used by the new experimental shuffle pads option. 

	* src/gap4/IO.c,
	* src/gap4/actf.c:
	Improved log file handling to write out the username opening the
	database and a message when the lock file is overridden. 

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c:
	More error checking on writing compressed files. 

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	Protect against the base spacing being listed as a negative number
	in the ABI file. 

	* src/mk/alpha.mk:
	Removed -rpath support as it causes more problems than it cures. 

	* src/gap4/contig_id.tcl,
	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl:
	The contig identifier box and the 'value' component in the editor
	search boxes are now automatically selected and focused, meaning
	that users can simply type over the previous value. 

2003-10-23 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/do_fij.c,
	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c,
	* src/gap4/hash_lib.h:
	Fixed a bug in Find Internal Joins where it failed to spot some
	matches. 

2003-10-22 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Added hyperlinks to the disassemble and 'set active list' lists
	created from the editor. 

2003-10-16  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/finish.[ch], src/prefinish/finish_utils.[ch]:
	Added an svec_as_cvec flag to allow SVEC tags to be treated as the
	clone end. This is useful for finishing EST sequences with one EST
	per contig.

2003-10-02 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c:
	Contig holes left after a disassembly are now stripped out, fixing
	db inconsistencies. This function will also be useful for the
	disassemble readings rewrite. 

2003-10-01 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* ChangeLog:
	*** empty log message *** 

	* src/gap4/IO.c:
	Ensure that io_length() memory cache is kept up to date when
	io_write_seq modifies it. 

	* src/prefinish/fake_insert_sizes.tcl,
	* src/prefinish/finish_cDNA,
	* src/prefinish/svec2cvec.tcl:
	New scripts for interfacing with the chickenEST project and the new
	finish_me3 perl script. 

	* src/gap4/hash_lib.c:
	Set upper limit on the size of set_band_blocks to 5000 so that
	really long alignments do not consume too much memory. 

	* src/g/freetree.c:
	When we have a tr->largest block long enough to hold the requested
	length, we were returning NULL (due to broken code ordering)
	instead of returning the block. This causes the database to
	unnecessarily grow! 

2003-09-04 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/prefinish/finish.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c,
	* src/prefinish/finish_sanger.tcl:
	When searching for a solution on the bottom strand, set the
	position to solve as the right hand end of this problem. Likewise
	for the top strand (which is true by default). 

2003-09-02 James Bonfield (jkb@sanger.ac.uk)

	* src/prefinish/finish.c:
	Fixed default value of pwalk_nsolutions from 400 (a cut and paste
	error) to 1. Luckily finish.tcl specified this explicitly. 

2003-08-07  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/seq_utils/dna_utils.c:
	Used (unsigned char) cast instead of (unsigned) for index to
	complementary base etc, otherwise it will cast to unsigned int and
	use a massive offset (4 billion or so) for 'negative' characters.

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl (select_oligos):
	Made GC Clamp parameter configurable.
	Remember the search ahead/back and seq length parameters for the
	duration of the gap4 session.

2003-08-06  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	Prevent the SPAC (average spacing) in abi files from being
	negative. How does this happen?
	Also disabled the base reordering code as I believe this is not
	the correct thing to do.

2003-08-05  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* lib/prefinish/finish.[ch]: 
	We now search for fake templates (func skip_fake_templates) based
	on looking for sequences without trace files. This is in addition
	to the usual skip_templates file and provides an easy automatic
	way of filtering out imported consensus sequences and the like.

	* src/g/freetree.c (tree_find_len):
	When we have a tr->largest block long enough to hold the requested
	length, we were returning NULL (due to broken code ordering)
	instead of returning the block. This causes the database to
	unnecessarily grow!

	* src/ftp/tk8.4.0/unix/tkUnixFont.c (Tk_DrawChars):
	Reverted the (my) patch to query the window size for optimising
	text printing, as the XGetGeometry call requires a round-trip
	message to the X server and hence gives very slow lag for remote
	connections.

2003-08-04  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/io_lib/utils/compress.c: 
	Check for errors in fcompress_file. If the file created was fopened
	using wb and not wb+ and fwrite_reading is used, then
	fcompress_file will fail as the process cannot read back the file
	it wrote.

2003-07-30  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* gap4_production link updated.

2003-07-23  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/stops/stops.c: Fixed a bug in peak height clipping in the
	first 50 or so bases are all just noise (no signal). We now fill
	out peaks with non-clipped data and do height clipping after
	finding the best average region.

	* src/stops/stops.c: Added a baseline parameter to add a fixed
	amount to all peaks. This 'small sample correction' is used for
	preventing artificially good results when looking at very low
	scores.

2003-07-17  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c, src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	Added -reseq_nsolutions, -long_nsolutions and -pwalk_nsolutions
	as configuration parameters.

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c: (implement_solutions):
	Added a notion of a result type having a desired number of
	solutions to use. This is distinct from the number of items in a
	group. Eg we may want to pick 2 primers, and use 3 templates for
	each. The main purpose for this though is for picking more than 1
	resequence experiment for each problem.

	* src/prefinish/finish_long.c (experiment_reseq):
	Fixed a bug in the use of strand vs sense. We now check sense for
	resequencing experiments as it doesn't matter if it's fwd or
	reverse sequence, just that it heads in the right direction.

2003-07-16  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c (score_experiments):
	Improved the score of experiments that have large groups. Eg more
	templates for a primer-walk are better than one.

	* src/gap4/extract.c (extract_readings): 
	The sort_readings function now returns an allocated structure
	holding the anchor read. This is used for replacing next_AP_left,
	which was VERY slow compared to the new method.

	* src/gap4/assemble_direct.c (assemble_direct):
	Directed assembly now ignores SL/SR lines when working out the
	left and right clip points, as this breaks copying data with
	extract readings. FIXME: this should be made optional.

2003-07-15  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/gap.tcl: Gap4 now 8.4b4.

2003-07-14  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceDisp.c:
	Added code to display signed values from trace files.

2003-07-10  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/tk_utils/restriction_enzyme_map.c (plot_renz_matches):
	Corrected plotting to use padded_cut_site instead of cut_site.

	* src/seq_utils/renz_utils.h, src/gap4/restriction_enzymes.c:
	Added a 'padded_cut_site' element to the R_Match structure. This
	is used by gap4's restriction enzyme displays to store the padded
	positions, which are needed for plotting and cursor control. The
	original unpadded value is left in R_Match->cut_site and hence the
	text outputs of fragment sizes and positions are correct.

2003-07-07  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/io_lib/abi/seqIOABI.c:
	Added support for reading phred-style confidence values from the
	ABI file.

2003-07-03  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/finish_filter.[ch], src/prefinish/finish.[ch],
	src/prefinish/finish_walk.c, src/prefinish/finish_main.c: 
	Added the filter_words algorithm into prefinish so that poly-A,
	GT-rich, etc can be filtered on. These are now also defined
	classification types and we check for different characters other
	than '#' in the finish_walk algorithms too.
	
2003-07-02  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	Output now includes the sequence preceeding the stop.
	Can now specify a directory name instead of files and the code
	iterates through the directory looking for SCF, ZTR and ABI files.

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.c (DrawCSTags):
	Fixed a buffer overflow in creating the canvas item 'tag' list.

2003-07-01  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/template.c:
	check_template_position() was resetting the consistency value to
	zero, which overwrites the CONSIST_STRAND flags. Deleted this.

2003-07-01  Rodger Staden  <rs@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk>

	* src/qclip/qclip.c (main):
	Set the maximum right hand quality clip to 10 million, as it was
	only 10K meaning reference/consensus sequences could be truncated.

2003-06-27  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c (DBgetTags): 
	Call DBgetSeq from DBgetTags to ensure the sequence info has been
	loaded; specifically sequence length. This is needed as DBgetTags
	does tag validity checking. Normally the sequence is loaded before
	the tags, but at startup the other way around can now occur due to
	the new multi-tag-under-cursor changes.
	
	* src/gap4/tman_interface.c (save_trace_images):
	Corrected mutation report generation when the mini-traces are shown.

2003-06-26  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/tman_diff.c (diff_readings):
	When a trace isn't there to diff against, we now create a blank
	Read instead of returning NULL. This fixes a bug of missing
	difference traces causing the mutation report to fail.

	* src/tk_utils/tkTrace.c (drawable_to_png):
	Better error handling. If png_create_write_struct failed it
	crashed trying to free png_ptr.

	* src/gap4/edMutations.c (sort_mutations):
	Remove buffer overflow. (Index using 1-N on an array alloc of N.)

	* src/gap4/searchUtils.c (edDoSearch):
	Searching could miss hits (eg tags, and probably many other
	things) when Group Readings by Templates was enabled.

2003-06-25  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/edUtils2.c (showCursor, onScreen):
	Scrolling down sequences when the Y-depth was too high would
	position the cursor on a sequence underneath the consensus line
	without Y scrolling the editor window properly.

	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl (EditCSTagDetails),
	src/gap4/contig_selector.c (DrawCSTags):
	New function with a binding "Edit contig at tag pos" menu. Right
	clicking in a tag in the contig selector now allows the editor to
	be brought up at that position.

2003-06-24  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Set -tearoffs 0 on cascading edit tag and delete tag menus.

	* distrib/unix-S1_1b/tables/gaprc:
	Adjusted a few defaults to match the Sanger defaults (where
	appropriate globally). We still need to maintain a sanger diff
	though for definite-local changes (such as huge fonts and
	'hotpink' highlight colours).

	* src/stops/stops.c:
	Tweak the default parameters to use a longer window length and
	fixed a bug in identifying stops to skip.

	* src/prefinish/add_stops.tcl:
	New script to parse the 'stops' program output and add gap4 STOP
	tags.

2003-06-20  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c(find_primers):
	When generating consensus for primer3 we now check the
	dust-filtering so as not to pick primers from low complexity
	sequence. These were filtered out later, but it's faster to prefilter.
	
	* src/prefinish/dust.c, src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	Tweaks the dust window from 64 to 48 and adjusted the dust score
	accordingly.

	* src/prefinish/finish.c, src/prefinish/finish_main.[ch]:
	Added code to keep track of when a 'virtual sequence' overlaps
	another virtual sequence. If more than 2/3rds of it does then we
	start applying a penalty. This is designed to filter out the cases
	where repeating a primer-walk just a few bases further along
	solves a few more bases.

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl
	Reenabled the "after 1000" Any-Configure binding for the editor as
	it seemed to necessary to prevent flickering on the Neon systems.

2003-06-19  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/vseqs.c(link_vrseq): 
	For creation of new virtual sequences from the consensus we now
	change consensus '-' characters into 'A'. This is with the
	assumption that the new sequence will not be undetermined at that
	point (but obviously it may not be A). The reason for this is to
	fix the consensus confidence, otherwise it'd remain at 1 (like all
	'-'s).

	* src/stops/*:
	First version of the 'stop' detector. At present it just outputs the 
	info to stdout. 

	* src/gap4/clip.[ch], src/gap4/clip.tcl, src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c,
	src/gap4/tclIndex, tables/gaprc, tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	Added a clip sequence by %age of non-ACGT (labelled N-clip). This
	solves a phrap alignment bug.

	* src/gap4/tag_editor.tcl:
	Fixed a bug with loading tag macros from .gaprc.

2003-06-16  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/trace_display.tcl (trace_flash): 
	Replace the trace-flash window to cover the whole height of the
	trace instead of +40 onwards. (+40 was inappropriate after we
	moved the base calls from the top to the bottom of the trace.)
	
	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Added 'break' to F1-F10 bindings so that the global keyboard menu
	traversal bindings do trigger.

2003-06-11  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/contigEditor.c, src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl,
	src/gap4/oligo.c, src/gap4/tagEditor.c, src/gap4/tagU1.c,
	src/gap4/tagUtils.h, src/gap4/tkEditor.c, tables/gaprc_menu_full:
	The Edit Tag and Delete tag editor commands are now cascading
	menus containing the list of all tags underneath the editing
	cursor. These lists are updated even if the menus have been torn
	off and after undo, etc.

2003-06-09  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* tables/gaprc_menu_full, tables/gaprc,
	src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Added an option to the Edit Modes menu to turn off fast tag
	deletion using F12 as this could be considered a dangerous option
	to allow by default.

2003-06-06  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/finish.c: set to version 1.19

	* src/prefinish/finish.tcl:
	Changed the optimisation on solving low consensus confidence
	problems; we now always check both strands. Slower, but better in
	some cases (and never worse).

	* src/prefinish/finish_main.c:
	Fixed setting classify bit CONTIG_LEFT_END and CONTIG_RIGHT_END so
	that the 'problem' is cleared when a sequence extends the contig.

	Added code to correctly score sequences that extend the contig (if
	extending is required) even though the problem being solved may
	not be the contig-extend problem.

	Added a +50% score bonus to any experiment that also solves all
	mandatory problems +/- 100 bases around the sequence. This gives
	an encouragement to not leave tiny problems which require another
	experiment.

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c:
	Rewrote the near_low_complexity() function. We are now allowed to
	use primers that are near a low complexity sequence provided the
	sequence extends though it and into at least opts.pwalk_seq_gap
	bases of non-low-complexity sequence.

	* src/gap4/contig_editor.tcl:
	Changed F11/F12 and Shift-F11/F12 to edit/delete tag for faster
	tag work.

	* src/gap4/editor_search.tcl, tables/gaprc:
	Remember the editor Search window settings as the default for new
	editors, so that we do not need to keep changing the dialogue.

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (ListContigsRepopulate): 
	Reset the yview after processing a REG_LENGTH or REG_JOIN_TO event
	so that the contig list stays scrolled to the same point.

2003-06-04  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* tables/gaprc:
	Added PRIMER.max_end_stability (=9) definition and adjusted the
	PRIMER.self_any definition from 4 to 5.

	* src/gap4/primlib.[ch]:
	Added max_end_stability as a configurable option to send to
	Primer3.

	* src/prefinish/finish.c, src/prefinish/finish.tcl,
	src/prefinish/param_primer3.itcl:
	Added support for specifying self_any, self_end, gc_clamp,
	max_poly_x, and max_end_stability primer3 options to the prefinish
	code and we now set these values in the example finish.tcl file.

2003-06-03  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (InitListContigs,
	ListContigsSelectPressBindng):
	Added a binding to update the global contig-identifier (and hence
	update open dialogue boxes) when clicking on a contig in the List
	Contigs box.

2003-05-30  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/dbcheck.c (check_readings):
	We now check that all sequence contains printable characters. This
	is an attempt to spot the source of the nul characters appearing
	in some sequences, although check database is now some 25% slower.

	* src/tk_utils/container.c (container_scroll_x, container_scroll_y): 
	Added a check for when get_container returns NULL (which it was
	doing due to being called incorrectly via the name-clash listed
	below).
	
	* src/gap4/contig_selector.tcl:
	* src/gap4/template_display.tcl:
	* src/gap4/gap_canvas_box.tcl:
	* src/gap4/gap_restriction_enzymes.tcl:
	* src/gap4/quality_plot.tcl:
	* src/gap4/stop_codon.tcl:
	* src/gap4/consistency_display.tcl:
	* src/gap4/confidence_graph.tcl:
	* src/gap4/reading_coverage.tcl:
	* src/gap4/readpair_coverage.tcl:
	* src/gap4/strand_coverage.tcl:
	Renamed scroll_x to gc_scroll_x, scroll_y to gc_scroll_y and
	get_next_row to c_get_next_row.
	This is to avoid name clashes with Kathryn's new spin2 container
	code in tk_utils (it seemed easier to rename the bits that I
	vaguely understand!).

2003-05-29  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/oligo.c (edSelectOligoGenerate):
	src/gap4/primlib.c (primlib_choose): 
	Fixed error handling when no primers are found; to solve a memory
	corruption and a crash.

	* tables/gaprc:
	Adjusted primer3 settings for self_any, opt_length, gc_clamp and
	max_poly_x.

	* src/gap4/primlib.[ch]:
	Added gc_clamp and max_poly_x, as a cofigurable parameter.
	Corrected parsing in primlib_str2args such that when the last
	parameter has a 1-character value it is still
	processed. (Previously it was just silently skipped.)

	* src/tk_utils/tkTraceIO.c (trace_init_pos): 
	Corrected the generation of blank trace arrays for EXP or PLN
	format sequences. We allocate the correct size traceA/C/G/T arrays
	and zero them. Without this change double clicking on a sequence
	in the editor whose trace is listed as an Experiment File that
	does not contain a LN line would cause a crash.

	* trace_display.tcl (trace_add): 
	Allow EXP files to be used for traces so that we can view traces
	via the LN/LT redirection.

	* src/gap4/edInterface.c (edSetCursor): 
	Corrected setting of xx->cursorSeq when the Y scrollbar is in use
	and the user clicks on the consensus. (This now means that all
	traces can be brought up again in such situations by double
	clicking on the consensus.)

	* src/gap4/tkEdUtils.c (positionCursor): 
	Due to switching the sequence to be at the bottom of the trace
	instead of the top the editing cursor in the editor was invisible
	(underneath the first line of trace) when embedded traces were in
	use. Now fixed

2003-05-27  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/rules/extend_left.rule,
	src/prefinish/rules/extend_right.rule:
	In the GUI prefinish configurator, we set the default strand for
	left and right contig extensions to be bottom and top
	respectively. Previously these were back to front resulting in
	pointless experiments!

	* src/gap4/tag_checklist.tcl (TagDialog_default):
	The "As Default" command now saves to the users .gaprc file too.

	* src/gap4/tag_checklist.tcl (tag_checklist):
	Select All and Clear All buttons are back (and where missing due
	to a typo).
	

2003-05-23  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/newgap_cmds.c (tcl_save_contig_order),
	  src/gap4/list_contigs.tcl (ListContigsSave):
	Added a save_contig_order Tcl/C command to write a new contig
	order (for all contigs). The "List Contigs" window now has a Save
	button which uses this to save the currently sorted order.

	* src/gap4/oligo.c (display_oligo_details):
	Added code to print the oligo details to the editor information
	line as well as to the Text Output window.

	* src/gap4/oligo_param.tcl (seloli_doit): Delete the code to blank the
	status line when bringing up the first primer after a manual (in
	editor) primer search.

2003-05-22  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/prefinish/finish_hash.c (hash_compare_primer): 
	Fix 'end' argument passed to false_priming. For bottom strand
	primers it was mixing up 5' and 3' ends and adding weight to the
	wrong one. Also minor debugging output changes.

	* src/prefinish/finish_walk.c: Changed the cost multiplier for
	primer secondary matches to be 1+pscore/100 instead of
	1+pscore/20, as the score doesn't seem to have a significant
	impact.

	* src/prefinish/tooltips.tcl (popup): Check for existance of a
	tooltip window and destroy it first if it exists. This fixes Tk
	errors (caused by rapid generation of events?).

2003-05-20  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* lib/tk/text.tcl (::tk::TextScanDrag): Allow 1 pixel of movement
	before switching to scan mode and setting mouseMoved flag. The
	mouseMoved flag disables pasting, and hence forceful middle
	clicking sometimes failed to paste.

2003-05-19  James Bonfield  <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>

	* src/gap4/join.c (align, alignOverlap): 
	Alignments now depad the sequence before using Rodger's alignment
	code. To deal with repadding I used the old code and converted the
	output from Rodger's algorithm to be compatible with the Myers and
	Miller style of output.
	Also fixed a display shift after aligning.
