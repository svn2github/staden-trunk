This directory contains a demonstration database consisting of several contigs.
The trace data has been base-called with phred, and converted to ZTR format.
To demonstrate distribution of data the traces are stored within a tar file,
but this does not need to be extracted in order to view the traces.

As phred confidence values are available the DEMO.0 database has also been
configured to start up using the "confidence value" mode of the consensus
algorithm. See the database notes for an example of how this was done.

You should be able to use Find Internal Joins to identify contig overlaps and
to join the data into one single contig.
